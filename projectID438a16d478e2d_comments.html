<h3>About the Author</h3>

<p><b>James Henderson Blount</b> (1869-1918) was an US judge who went in to the Philippines as a volunteer shortly after the US took over this colony from Spain. After his experiences, he became highly critical of the US policy in the Philippines, and urged for an early independence of the country.

<h3>About the work</h3>

<p><i>The American Occupation of the Philippines, 1898-1912</i> (1912) is a highly critical work on the American rule in the Philippines. This work is much criticized by Dean Worchester in his book, the <i><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/12077">Philippines, Past and Present</a></i>, already present in Project Gutenberg. He was only returning the favor, as Dean Worcester receives one chapter of heavy criticism in the current work. Having these conflicting points of view on this first major foreign operation of the US is important for understanding it.

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>Fairly straightforward. Includes a few longer quotations in smaller type, which should be marked with /# #/ in the formatting round. If the Peso sign (a P with a horizontal bar through it) appears, use [P]. Some reader underlining hindered the OCR. Please fix this.
