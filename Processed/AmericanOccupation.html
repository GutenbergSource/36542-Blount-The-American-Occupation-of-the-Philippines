<p class="first">To have gone out to the other side of the world with
an army of invasion, and had a part, however small, in the subjugation
of a strange people, and then to see a new government set up, and, as
an official of that government, watch it work out through a number of
years, is an unusual and interesting experience, especially to a
lawyer. What seem to me the most valuable things I learned in the
course of that experience are herein submitted to my fellow-countrymen,
in connection with a narrative covering the whole of the American
occupation of the Philippines to date.</p>
<p>This book is an attempt, by one whose intimate acquaintance with two
remotely separated peoples will be denied in no quarter, to interpret
each to the other. How intelligent that acquaintance is, is of course
altogether another matter, which the reader will determine for
himself.</p>
<p>The task here undertaken is to make audible to a great free nation
the voice of a weaker subject people who passionately and rightly long
to be also free, but whose longings have been systematically denied for
the last fourteen years, sometimes ignorantly, sometimes viciously, and
always cruelly, on the wholly erroneous <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd27e254" href="#xd27e254" name="xd27e254">vi</a>]</span>idea that
where the <i>end</i> is benevolent, it justifies the <i>means</i>,
regardless of the means necessary to the end.</p>
<p>At a time when all our military and fiscal experts agree that having
the Philippines on our hands is a grave strategic and economic mistake,
fraught with peril to the nation&rsquo;s prestige in the early stages
of our next great war, we are keeping the Filipinos in industrial
bondage through unrighteous Congressional legislation for which special
interests in America are responsible, in bald repudiation of the Open
Door policy, and against their helpless but universal protest, a wholly
unprotected and easy prey to the first first-class Power with which we
become involved in war. Yet all the while the very highest
considerations of national honor require us to choose between making
the Filipino people free and independent without unnecessary delay, as
they of right ought to be, or else imperilling the perpetuity of our
own institutions by the creation and maintenance of a great standing
army, sufficient properly to guard overseas possessions.</p>
<p>A cheerful blindness to the inevitable worthy of Mark Tapley
himself, the stale Micawberism that &ldquo;something is bound to turn
up,&rdquo; and a Mrs. Jellyby philanthropy hopelessly callous to
domestic duties, expenses, and distresses, have hitherto successfully
united to prevent the one simple and supreme need of the
situation&mdash;a frank, formal, and definite declaration, by <i>the
law-making power</i> of the government, of the nation&rsquo;s purpose
in the premises. What is needed is a formal legislative announcement
that the governing of a remote and alien people is to have no permanent
place in the purposes of our national life, and that we do <i>bona
fide</i> intend, just as soon as a stable government, republican in
form, can be established by the people of the Philippine Islands, to
turn over, upon terms which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e272"
href="#xd27e272" name="xd27e272">vii</a>]</span>shall be reasonable and
just, the government and control of the islands to the people
thereof.</p>
<p>The essentials of the problem, being at least as immutable as human
nature and geography, will not change much with time. And whenever the
American people are ready to abandon the strange gods whose guidance
has necessitated a new definition of Liberty consistent with taxation
without representation and unanimous protest by the governed, they will
at once set about to secure to a people who have proven themselves
brave and self-sacrificing in war, and gentle, generous, and tractable
in peace, the right to pursue happiness in <i>their own</i> way, in
lieu of somebody else&rsquo;s way, as the spirit of our Constitution,
and the teachings of our God, Who is also theirs, alike demand.</p>
<p>After seven years spent at the storm-centre of so-called
&ldquo;Expansion,&rdquo; the first of the seven as a volunteer officer
in Cuba during and after the Spanish War, the next two in a like
capacity in the Philippines, and the remainder as a United States judge
in the last-named country, the writer was finally invalided home in
1905, sustained in spirit, at parting, by cordial farewells, oral and
written, personal and official, but convinced that foreign kindness
will not cure the desire of a people, once awakened, for what used to
be known as Freedom before we freed Cuba and then subjugated the
Philippines; and that to permanently eradicate sedition from the
Philippine Islands, the American courts there must be given
jurisdiction over thought as well as over overt act, and must learn the
method of drawing an indictment against a whole people.</p>
<p>Seven other years of interested observation from the Western
Hemisphere end of the line have confirmed and fortified the convictions
above set forth.</p>
<p>If we give the Filipinos this independence they so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd27e285" href="#xd27e285" name=
"xd27e285">viii</a>]</span>ardently desire and ever clamor for until
made to shut up, &ldquo;the holy cause,&rdquo; as their brilliant young
representative in the American House of Representatives, Mr. Quezon,
always calls it, will <i>not</i> be at once spoiled, as the American
hemp and other special interests so contemptuously insist, by the
gentleman named, and his compatriot, Se&ntilde;or Osme&ntilde;a, the
Speaker of the Philippine Assembly, and the rest of the leaders of the
patriot cause, in a general mutual throat-cutting incidental to a
scramble for the offices. This sort of contention is merely the hiss of
the same old serpent of tyranny which has always beset the pathway of
man&rsquo;s struggle for free institutions.</p>
<p>When first the talk in America, after the battle of Manila Bay,
about keeping the Philippines, reached the islands, one of the Filipino
leaders wrote to another during the negotiations between their
commanding general and our own looking to preservation of the peace
until the results of the Paris Peace Conference which settled the fate
of the islands should be known, in effect, thus: &ldquo;The Filipinos
will not be fit for independence in ten, twenty, or a hundred years if
it be left to American colonial office-holders drawing good salaries to
determine the question.&rdquo; Is there not some human nature in that
remark? Suppose, reader, you were in the enjoyment of a salary of five,
ten, or twenty thousand dollars a year as a government official in the
Philippines, how precipitately would you hasten to recommend yourself
out of office, and evict yourself into this cold Western world with
which you had meantime lost all touch?</p>
<p>The Filipinos can run a far better government than the Cubans. In
1898, when Admiral Dewey read in the papers that we were going to give
Cuba independence, he wired home from Manila: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd27e295" href="#xd27e295" name=
"xd27e295">ix</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">These people are far superior in their intelligence,
and more capable of self-government than the people of Cuba, and I am
familiar with both races.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a year in Cuba and nearly six in the Philippines, two as an
officer of the army that subjugated the Filipinos, and the remainder as
a judge over them, I cordially concur in the opinion of Admiral Dewey,
but with this addition, viz., that the people of those islands,
whatever of conscious political unity they may have lacked in 1898,
were welded into absolute oneness as a people by their original
struggle for independence against us, and will remain forever so welded
by their incurable aspirations for a national life of their own under a
republic framed in imitation of ours. Furthermore, the one great
difference between Cuba and the Philippines is that the latter country
has no race cancer forever menacing its peace, and sapping its
self-reliance. The Philippine people are absolutely one people, as to
race, color, and previous condition. Again, American sugar and tobacco
interests will never permit the competitive Philippine sugar and
tobacco industries to grow as Nature and Nature&rsquo;s God intended;
and the American importers of Manila hemp&mdash;which is to the
Philippines what cotton is to the South&mdash;have, through special
Congressional legislation still standing on our statute books&mdash;to
the shame of the nation&mdash;so depressed the hemp industry of the
islands that the market price it brings to-day is just one half what it
brought ten years ago.</p>
<p>If three strong and able Americans, familiar with insular conditions
and still young enough to undertake the task, were told by a President
of the United States, by authority of Congress, &ldquo;Go out there and
set up a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e304" href="#xd27e304" name=
"xd27e304">x</a>]</span>stable native government by July 4,
1921,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e306src" href="#xd27e306" name=
"xd27e306src">1</a> and then come away,&rdquo; they could and would do
it; and that government would be a success; and one of the greatest
moral victories in the annals of free government would have been
written by the gentlemen concerned upon the pages of their
country&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>We ought to give the Filipinos their independence, even if we have
to guarantee it to them. But, by neutralization treaties with the other
great Powers similar to those which safeguard the integrity and
independence of Switzerland to-day, whereby the other Powers would
agree not to seize the islands after we give them their independence,
the Philippines can be made as permanently neutral territory in Asiatic
politics as Switzerland is to-day in European politics.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;The preparation of this book has entailed examination of
a vast mass of official documents, as will appear from the foot-note
citations to the page and volume from which quotations have been made.
The object has been to place all material statements of fact beyond
question. For the purpose of this research work, Mr. Herbert Putnam,
Librarian of Congress, was kind enough to extend me the privileges of
the national library, and it would be most ungracious to fail to
acknowledge the obligation I am under, in this regard, to one whom the
country is indeed fortunate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd27e326"
href="#xd27e326" name="xd27e326">xi</a>]</span>in having at the head of
that great institution. I should also make acknowledgment of the
obligation I am under to Mr. W. W. Bishop, the able superintendent of
the reading-room, for aid rendered whenever asked, and to my life-long
friends, John and Hugh Morrison, the most valuable men, to the general
public, except the two gentlemen above named, on the whole great roll
of employees of the Library of Congress.</p>

<p class="first">Any narrative covering our acquisition of the
Philippine Islands must, of course, centre in the outset about Admiral
Dewey, and the destruction by him of the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay on
Sunday morning, May 1, 1898. But as the Admiral had brought Aguinaldo
down from Hong Kong to Manila after the battle, and landed him on May
19th to start an auxiliary insurrection, which insurrection kept the
Spaniards bottled up in Manila on the land side for three and a half
months while Dewey did the same by sea, until ten thousand American
troops arrived, and easily completed the reduction and capture of the
beleaguered and famished city on August 13th, it is necessary to a
clear understanding of the <i>de facto</i> alliance between the
Americans and Aguinaldo thus created, to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>know who brought the Admiral
and Aguinaldo together and how, and why.</p>
<p>The United States declared war against Spain, April 21, 1898, to
free Cuba, and at once arranged an understanding with the Cuban
revolutionists looking to co-operation between their forces and ours to
that end. For some years prior to this, political conditions in the
Philippines had been quite similar to those in Cuba, so that when, two
days after war broke out, the Honorable Spencer Pratt, Consul-General
of the United States at Singapore, in the British Straits Settlements,
found Aguinaldo, who had headed the last organized outbreak against
Spain in the Philippines, temporarily sojourning as a political refugee
at Singapore, in the Filipino colony there, he naturally sought to
arrange for his co-operating with us against Spain, as Gomez and Garcia
were doing in Cuba. Thereby hangs the story of &ldquo;Mr. Pratt&rsquo;s
Serenade.&rdquo; However, before we listen to the band whose strains
spoke the gratitude of the Filipinos to Mr. Pratt for having introduced
Aguinaldo to Dewey, let us learn somewhat of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
antecedents, as related to the purposes of the introduction.</p>
<p>The first low rumbling of official thunder premonitory to the war
with Spain was heard in Mr. McKinley&rsquo;s annual message to Congress
of December, 1897,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e811src" href="#xd27e811"
name="xd27e811src">1</a> wherein he said, among other things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The most important problem with which this government
is now called upon to deal pertaining to its foreign relations concerns
its duty toward Spain and the Cuban insurrection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In that very month of December, 1897, Aguinaldo was heading a
formidable insurrection against Spanish <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>tyranny in the Philippines,
and the Filipinos and their revolutionary committees everywhere were
watching with eager interest the course of &ldquo;The Great North
American Republic,&rdquo; as they were wont to term our government.</p>
<p>The Report of the First Philippine Commission sent out to the
Islands by President McKinley in February, 1899, of which President
Schurman of Cornell University was Chairman, contains a succinct
memorandum concerning the Filipino revolutionary movement of
1896&ndash;7, which had been begun by Aguinaldo in 1896, and had
culminated in what is known as the Treaty of Biac-na-Bato,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e826src" href="#xd27e826" name="xd27e826src">2</a>
signed December 14, 1897. This treaty had promised certain reforms,
such as representation in the Spanish Cortez, sending the Friars away,
etc., and had also promised the leaders $400,000 if Aguinaldo and his
Cabinet would leave the country and go to Hong Kong. &ldquo;No definite
time was fixed,&rdquo; says President Schurman (vol. I., p. 171),
&ldquo;during which these men were to remain away from the Philippines;
and if the promises made by Spain were not fulfilled, they had the
right to return.&rdquo; Of course, &ldquo;the promises made by
Spain&rdquo; were <i>not</i> fulfilled. Spain thought she had bought
Aguinaldo and his crowd off. &ldquo;Two hundred thousand
dollars,&rdquo; says Prof. Schurman, &ldquo;was paid to Aguinaldo when
he arrived in Hong Kong.&rdquo; But instead of using this money in
riotous living, the little group of exiles began to take notice of the
struggles of their brothers in wretchedness in Cuba, and the
ever-increasing probability of intervention by the United States in
that unhappy Spanish colony, which, of course, would be <i>their</i>
opportunity to strike for Independence. They had only been in Hong Kong
about two months when the <i>Maine</i> blew up <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>February 15,
1898, Then they knew there would be &ldquo;something doing.&rdquo; Hong
Kong being the cross-roads of the Far East and the gateway to Asia, and
being only sixty hours across the choppy China Sea from Manila, was the
best place in that part of the world to brew another insurrection
against Spain. But Singapore is also a good place for a branch office
for such an enterprise, being on the main-travelled route between the
Philippines and Spain by way of the Suez Canal, about four or five days
out of Hong Kong by a good liner, and but little farther from Manila,
as the crow flies, than Hong Kong itself. Owing to political unrest in
the Philippines in 1896&ndash;7&ndash;8, there was quite a colony of
Filipino political refugees living at Singapore during that period.
Aguinaldo had gone over from Hong Kong to Singapore in the latter half
of April, 1898, arriving there, it so chanced, the day we declared war
against Spain, April 21st. He was immediately sought out by Mr. Pratt,
who had learned of his presence in the community through an Englishman
of Singapore, a former resident of Manila, a Mr. Bray, who seems to
have been a kind of striker for the Filipino general. Aguinaldo had
come <i>incognito</i>. Out of Mr. Pratt&rsquo;s interview with the
insurgent chief thus obtained, and its results, grew the episode which
is the subject of this chapter.</p>
<p>A word just here, preliminary to this interview, concerning the
personal equation of Aguinaldo, would seem to be advisable.</p>
<p>While I personally chased him and his outfit a good deal in the
latter part of 1899, in the northern advance of a column of General
Lawton&rsquo;s Division from San Isidro across the Rio Grande de
Pampanga, over the boggy passes of the Caraballa Mountains to the China
Sea, and up the Luzon West Coast road, we never did <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>catch him,
and I never personally met him but once, and that was after he was
captured in 1901. He was as insignificant looking physically as a
Japanese diplomat. But his presence suggested, equally with that of his
wonderful racial cousins who represent the great empire of the Mikado
abroad, both a high order of intelligence and baffling reserve. And
Major-General J. Franklin Bell, recently Chief of Staff, United States
Army, who was a Major on General Merritt&rsquo;s staff in 1898, having
charge of the &ldquo;Office of Military Information,&rdquo; in a
confidential report prepared for his chief dated August 29, 1898,
&ldquo;sizing up&rdquo; the various insurgent leaders, in view of the
then apparent probability of trouble with them, gives these notes on
Aguinaldo, the head and front of the revolution: &ldquo;Aguinaldo:
Honest, sincere, and *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* a natural leader of
men.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e850src" href="#xd27e850" name=
"xd27e850src">3</a></p>
<p>Any one acquainted with General Bell knows that he knows what he is
talking about when he speaks of &ldquo;a natural leader of men,&rdquo;
for he is one himself. Our ablest men in the early days were the first
to cease considering the little brown soldiers a joke, and their
government an <i>opera-bouffe</i> affair. General Bell also says in the
same report that he, Aguinaldo, is undoubtedly endowed in a wonderful
degree with &ldquo;the power of creating among the people confidence in
himself.&rdquo; He was, indeed, the very incarnation of &ldquo;the
legitimate aspirations of&rdquo; his people, to use one of the favorite
phrases of his early state papers, and the faithful interpreter
thereof. That was the secret of his power, that and a most remarkable
talent for surrounding himself with an atmosphere of impenetrable
reserve. This last used to make our young army officers suspect him of
being what they called a &ldquo;four-flusher,&rdquo; which being
interpreted means a man who is partially successful <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>in making
people think him far more important than he really is. But we have seen
General Bell&rsquo;s estimate. And the day Aguinaldo took the oath of
allegiance to the United States, in 1901, General MacArthur, then
commanding the American forces in the Philippines, signalized the event
by liberating 1000 Filipino prisoners of war. General Funston, the man
who captured him in 1901, says in <i>Scribner&rsquo;s Magazine</i> for
November, 1911, &ldquo;He is a man of many excellent qualities and
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* far and away the best Filipino I was ever brought in
contact with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aguinaldo was born in 1869. To-day, 1912, he is farming about twenty
miles out of Manila in his native province of Cavite; has always
scrupulously observed his oath of allegiance aforesaid; occasionally
comes to town and plays chess with Governor-General Forbes; and in all
respects has played for the last ten years with really fine dignity the
r&ocirc;le of Chieftain of a Lost Cause on which his all had been
staked. He was a school-teacher at Cavite at one time, but is not a
college graduate, and so far as mere book education is concerned, he is
not a highly educated man. Whether or not he can give the principal
parts of the principal irregular Greek verbs I do not know, but his
place in the history of his country, and in the annals of wars for
independence, cannot, and for the honor of human nature should not, be
a small one. Dr. Rizal, the Filipino patriot whose picture we print on
the Philippine postage stamps, and who was shot for sedition by the
Spaniards before our time out there, was what Colonel Roosevelt would
jocularly call &ldquo;one of these darned literary fellows.&rdquo; He
was a sort of &ldquo;Sweetness and Light&rdquo; proposition, who only
<i>wrote</i> about &ldquo;The Rights of Man,&rdquo; and finally
<i>let</i> the Spaniards shoot him&mdash;stuck his head in the
lion&rsquo;s mouth, so to speak. Aguinaldo was a born <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>leader of
men, who knew how to put the fear of God into the hearts of the ancient
oppressors of his people. Mr. Pratt&rsquo;s own story of how he earned
his serenade is preserved to future ages in the published records of
the State Department.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e876src" href=
"#xd27e876" name="xd27e876src">4</a> We will now attempt to summarize,
not so eloquently as Mr. Pratt, but more briefly, the manner of its
earning, the serenade itself, and its resultant effects both upon the
personal fortunes of Mr. Pratt and upon Filipino confidence in American
official assurances.</p>
<p>It was on the evening of Saturday, April 23, 1898, that Mr. Pratt
was confidentially informed of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s arrival at Singapore,
<i>incognito</i>. &ldquo;Being aware,&rdquo; says Mr. Pratt, &ldquo;of
the great prestige of General Aguinaldo with the insurgents, and that
no one, either at home or abroad, could exert over them the same
influence and control that he could, I determined at once to see
him.&rdquo; Accordingly, he did see him the following Sunday morning,
the 24th.</p>
<p>At this interview, it was arranged that if Admiral Dewey, then at
Hong Kong with his squadron awaiting orders, should so desire,
Aguinaldo should proceed to Hong Kong to arrange for co-operation of
the insurgents at Manila with our naval forces in the prospective
operations against the Spaniards.</p>
<p>Accordingly, that Sunday, Mr. Pratt telegraphed Dewey through our
consul at Hong Kong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Aguinaldo, insurgent leader, here. Will come Hong Kong
arrange with Commodore for general co-operation insurgents Manila if
desired. Telegraph.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Admiral Dewey (then Commodore) replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Tell Aguinaldo come soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span></p>
<p>This message was received late Sunday night, April 24th, and was at
once communicated to Aguinaldo. Mr. Pratt then did considerable
bustling around for the benefit of his new-found ally, whom, with his
aide-de-camp and private secretary, all under assumed names he
&ldquo;succeeded in getting off,&rdquo; to use his phrase, by the
British steamer <i>Malacca</i>, which left Singapore for Hong Kong,
April 26th. In the letter reporting all this to the State Department,
Mr. Pratt adds that he trusts this action &ldquo;in arranging for his
[Aguinaldo&rsquo;s] direct co-operation with the commander of our
forces&rdquo; will meet with the Government&rsquo;s approval. A little
later Mr. Pratt sends the State Department a copy of the <i>Singapore
Free Press</i> of May 4, 1898, containing an impressive account of the
above transaction and the negotiations leading up to it. This account
describes the political conditions among the population of the
Philippine archipelago, &ldquo;which,&rdquo; it goes on to say,
&ldquo;merely awaits the signal from General Aguinaldo to rise <i>en
masse</i>.&rdquo; Speaking of Pratt&rsquo;s interview with Aguinaldo,
it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">General Aguinaldo&rsquo;s policy embraces the
independence of the Philippines. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* American protection
would be desirable temporarily, on the same lines as that which might
be instituted hereafter in Cuba.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Pratt also forwards a proclamation gotten up by the Filipino
insurgent leaders at Hong Kong and sent over to the Philippines in
advance of Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s coming, calling upon the Filipinos not
to heed any appeals of the Spaniards to oppose the Americans, but to
rally to the support of the latter. This manifesto of the Filipinos is
headed, prominently&mdash;for all we know it may have had a heading as
big as a Hearst newspaper <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href=
"#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>box-car type announcement of the latest
violation of the Seventh Commandment&mdash;: &ldquo;America&rsquo;s
Allies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It begins thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Compatriots: Divine Providence is about to place
independence within our reach. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The Americans, not from
mercenary motives, but for the sake of humanity and the lamentations of
so many persecuted people, have considered it opportune *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
etc. [Here follows a reference to Cuba.] At the present moment an
American squadron is preparing to sail for the Philippines.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The Americans will attack by sea and prevent any
reinforcements coming from Spain; *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* we insurgents must
attack by land. Probably you will have more than sufficient arms,
because the Americans have arms and will find means to assist us.
<i>There where you see the American flag flying, assemble in numbers;
they are our redeemers!</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e931src" href=
"#xd27e931" name="xd27e931src">5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For twelve days after his letter to the State Department enclosing
the above proclamation, Mr. Pratt, so far as the record discloses,
contemplated his <i lang="fr">coup <span class="corr" id="xd27e940"
title="Source: d&rsquo; &eacute;tat">d&rsquo;&eacute;tat</span></i> in
silent satisfaction. Since its successful pulling off, Admiral Dewey
had smashed the Spanish fleet, and Aguinaldo had started his auxiliary
insurrection. The former was patting the latter on the back, as it
were, and saying, &ldquo;Go it little man.&rdquo; But nobody was
patting Pratt on the back, yet. Therefore, on June 2d, Mr. Pratt writes
the State Department, purring for patting thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Considering the enthusiastic manner General Aguinaldo
has been received by the natives and the confidence with which he
already appears to have inspired Admiral Dewey, it will be admitted, I
think, that I did not over-rate his importance and <i>that I have
materially assisted</i> the cause of the United States in the
Philippines in securing his co-operation.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e949src" href="#xd27e949" name="xd27e949src">6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span></p>
<p>A glow of conscious superiority, in value to the Government, over
his consular colleague and neighbor, Mr. Wildman, at Hong Kong, next
suffuses Mr. Pratt&rsquo;s diction, being manifested thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Why this co-operation should not have been secured to
us during the months General Aguinaldo remained awaiting events in Hong
Kong, and that he was allowed to leave there without having been
approached in the interest of our Government, I cannot understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering that in his letter accepting the nomination for the
Vice-Presidency two years after this Mr. Roosevelt compared Aguinaldo
and his people to that squalid old Apache medicine man, Sitting Bull,
and his band of dirty paint-streaked cut-throats, Mr. Pratt&rsquo;s
next Pickwickian sigh of complacent, if neglected, worth is
particularly interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">No <i>close observer</i> of what had transpired in the
Philippines during the past four years could have failed to recognize
that General Aguinaldo enjoyed above all others the confidence of the
Filipino insurgents and the respect alike of Spaniards and foreigners
in the islands, all of whom vouched for his high sense of justice and
honor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, knowing the proverbial ingratitude of republics, Mr.
Pratt is determined to impress upon his Government and on the
discerning historian of the future that he was &ldquo;the original
Aguinaldo man.&rdquo; A week later (June 9th) Mr. Pratt writes the
Department enclosing copies of the Singapore papers of that date,
giving an account of a generous outburst of Filipino enthusiasm at
Singapore in honor of America, Admiral Dewey, and, last, if not least,
Mr. Pratt. He encloses duplicate copies of these newspaper notices
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>&ldquo;for the press, should you consider their
publication desirable.&rdquo; His letter begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I have the honor to report that this afternoon, on the
occasion of the receipt of the news of General Aguinaldo&rsquo;s recent
successes near Manila, I was waited upon by the Philippine residents in
Singapore and presented an address. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then proceeds with further details of the event, without
self-laudation. The Singapore papers which he encloses, however, not
handicapped by the inexorable modesty of official correspondence, give
a glowing account of the presentation of the &ldquo;address,&rdquo; and
of the serenade and toasts which followed. Says one of them, the
<i>Straits Times:</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The United States consulate at Singapore was yesterday
afternoon in an unusual state of bustle. That bustle extended itself to
Raffles Hotel, of which the consulate forms an outlying part. From a
period shortly prior to 5 o&rsquo;clock, afternoon, the natives of the
Philippines resident in Singapore began to assemble at the consulate.
Their object was to present an address to Hon. Spencer Pratt, United
States Consul-General, and, partly, to serenade him, for which purpose
some twenty-five or thirty of the Filipinos came equipped with musical
instruments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First there was music by the band. Then followed the formal reading
and presentation of the address by a Dr. Santos, representing the
Filipino community of Singapore. The address pledged the &ldquo;eternal
gratitude&rdquo; of the Filipino people to Admiral Dewey and the
honored addressee, alluded to the glories of independence, and to how
Aguinaldo had been enabled by the arrangement so happily effected with
Admiral Dewey by Consul Pratt to arouse 8,000,000 of Filipinos to take
up <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>arms &ldquo;in defence of those principles of
justice and liberty of which your country is the foremost
champion&rdquo; and trusted &ldquo;that the United States
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* will efficaciously second the programme arranged
between you, sir, and General Aguinaldo in this port of Singapore, and
secure to us our independence under the protection of the United
States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pratt arose and &ldquo;proceeded speaking in French,&rdquo; says
the newspaper&mdash;it does not say Alabama French, but that is
doubtless what it was&mdash;&ldquo;to state his belief that the
Filipinos would prove and were now proving themselves fit for
self-government.&rdquo; The gentleman from Alabama then went on to
review the mighty events and developments of the preceding six weeks,
Dewey&rsquo;s victory of May 1st,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">the brilliant achievements of your own distinguished
leader, General Emilio Aguinaldo, <i>co-operating on land with the
Americans at sea</i>, etc. You have just reason to be proud of what has
been and is being accomplished by General Aguinaldo and your
fellow-countrymen under his command. When, six weeks ago, I learned
that General Aguinaldo had arrived <i>incognito</i> in Singapore, I
immediately <i>sought him out</i>. An hour&rsquo;s interview convinced
me that he was <i>the man for the occasion</i>; and, having
communicated with Admiral Dewey, I accordingly arranged for him to join
the latter, which he did at Cavite. The rest you know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Says the newspaper clipping which has preserved the Pratt oration:
&ldquo;At the conclusion of Mr. Pratt&rsquo;s speech refreshments were
served, and as the Filipinos, <i>being Christians, drink
alcohol</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1015src" href="#xd27e1015"
name="xd27e1015src">7</a> there was no difficulty in arranging as to
refreshments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then followed a general drinking of toasts to America, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>Dewey,
Pratt, and Aguinaldo. Then the band played. Then the meeting broke up.
Then the Honorable Spencer Pratt, Consul-General of the United States,
retired to the seclusion of his apartments in Raffles Hotel, and, under
the soothing swish of his <i>plunkah</i>, forgot the accursed heat of
that stepping-off place, Singapore, and dreamed of future
greatness.</p>
<p>A few days later the even tenor of Mr. Pratt&rsquo;s meditations was
disturbed by a letter from the State Department saying, in effect, that
it was all right to get Aguinaldo&rsquo;s assistance &ldquo;<i>if</i>
in so doing he was not induced to form hopes which it might not be
practicable to gratify.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1030src"
href="#xd27e1030" name="xd27e1030src">8</a> But it did <i>not</i> tell
him to tell the Filipinos so. For Aguinaldo was keeping the Spaniards
bottled up in the old walled city of Manila on short and ever
shortening rations, and American troops were on the way to join him,
and the shorter the food supply grew in Manila the readier the garrison
would be to surrender when they did arrive, and the fewer American
soldiers&rsquo; lives would have to be sacrificed in the final capture
of the town. Every day of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s service under the
Dewey-Pratt arrangement was worth an American life, perhaps many. It
was too valuable to repudiate, just yet. July 20th, the State
Department wrote Mr. Pratt a letter acknowledging receipt of his of
June 9th &ldquo;enclosing printed copies of a report from the
<i>Straits Times</i> of the same day, entitled &lsquo;Mr. Spencer
Pratt&rsquo;s Serenade,&rsquo; with a view to its communication to the
press,&rdquo; and not only not felicitating him <i>on</i> his serenade,
but making him sorry he had ever <i>had</i> a serenade. It said, among
other things:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The extract now communicated by you from the <i>Straits
Times</i> of the 9th of June has occasioned <i>a feeling of disquietude
and a doubt as to whether some of your acts <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>may not
have borne a significance and produced an impression which this
government would feel compelled to regret</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e1058src" href="#xd27e1058" name="xd27e1058src">9</a> Hapless
Pratt! &ldquo;Feel compelled to regret&rdquo; is State Department for
&ldquo;You are liable to be fired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter of reprimand proceeds:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The address *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* discloses an understanding on
their part that *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* the ultimate object of our action is
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* the independence of the Philippines *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.
Your address does not repel this implication
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The letter then scores Pratt for having called Aguinaldo &ldquo;the
man for the occasion,&rdquo; and for having said that the
&ldquo;arrangement&rdquo; between Aguinaldo and Dewey had
&ldquo;resulted so happily,&rdquo; and after a few further
animadversions, concludes with this great blow to the reading public of
Alabama:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For these reasons the Department has not caused the article
to be given to the press lest it might seem thereby to lend a sanction
to views the expression of which it had not authorized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Department&rdquo; was very scrupulous about even the
appearance, at the American end of the line, of &ldquo;lending a
sanction&rdquo; to Pratt&rsquo;s arrangement with Aguinaldo, while all
the time it was knowingly permitting the latter to daily risk his own
life and the lives of his countrymen on the faith of that very
&ldquo;arrangement,&rdquo; and it was so permitting this to be done
because the &ldquo;arrangement&rdquo; was daily operating to reduce the
number of American lives which it would be necessary to sacrifice in
the final taking of Manila. The day the letter of reprimand was written
our troop-ships were on the ocean, speeding toward the Philippines. And
Aguinaldo and his people were fighting the Spaniards with the pent-up
feeling of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>centuries impelling their little steel-jacketed
messengers of death, thinking of &ldquo;Cuba Libre,&rdquo; and dreaming
of a Star of Philippine Independence risen in the Far East.</p>
<p>Such are the circumstances from which the Filipino people derived
their first impressions concerning the faith and honor of a strange
people they had never theretofore seen, who succeeded the Spaniards as
their overlords. Mr. Pratt was subsequently quietly separated from the
consular service, and doubtless lived to regret that he had ever
unloosed the fountains of his Alabama French on the Filipino colony of
Singapore. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=

<p class="first">The battle of Manila Bay was fought May 1, 1898. Until
the thunder of Dewey&rsquo;s guns reverberated around the world, there
was perhaps no part of it the American people knew less about than the
Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>We have all heard much of what happened after the battle, but
comparatively few, probably, have ever had a glimpse at our great
sailor while he was there in Hong Kong harbor, getting ready to go to
sea to destroy the Spanish armada. Such a glimpse is modestly afforded
by the Admiral in his testimony before the Senate Committee in
1902.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1099src" href="#xd27e1099" name=
"xd27e1099src">1</a></p>
<p>Asked by the Committee when he first heard from Aguinaldo and his
people in 1898, Admiral Dewey said<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1107src"
href="#xd27e1107" name="xd27e1107src">2</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I should think about a month before leaving Hong Kong,
that is, about the first of April, when it became pretty certain that
there was to be war with Spain, I heard that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>there
were a number of Filipinos in the city of Hong Kong who were anxious to
accompany the squadron to Manila in case we went over. I saw these men
two or three times myself. They seemed to be all very young earnest
boys. I did not attach much importance to what they said or to
themselves. Finally, before we left Hong Kong for Mirs Bay<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1117src" href="#xd27e1117" name="xd27e1117src">3</a>
I received a telegram from Consul-General Pratt at Singapore saying
that Aguinaldo was there and anxious to see me. I said to him
&ldquo;All right; tell him to come on,&rdquo; but I attached so little
importance to Aguinaldo that I did not wait for him. He did not arrive,
and we sailed from Mirs Bay without any Filipinos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From his testimony before the Committee it is clear that Admiral
Dewey&rsquo;s first impressions of the Filipinos, like those of most
Americans after him, were not very favorable, that is to say, he did
not in the outset take them very seriously. It will be interesting to
consider these impressions, and then to compare them with those he
gathered on better acquaintance from observing their early struggles
for independence. The more intimate acquaintance, as has been the case
with all his fellow countrymen since, caused him to revise his first
verdict. Answering a question put by Senator Carmack concerning what
transpired between him and the Philippine Revolutionists at Hong Kong
before he sailed in search of the Spanish fleet, the Admiral
said<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1126src" href="#xd27e1126" name=
"xd27e1126src">4</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">They were bothering me. I was getting my squadron
ready for battle, and these little men were coming on board my ship at
Hong Kong and taking a good deal of my time, and I did not attach the
slightest importance to anything they could do, and they did nothing;
that is, none of them went with me when I went to Mirs Bay. There had
been a good deal of talk, but when the time came they did not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>go. <i>One of them didn&rsquo;t go because he
didn&rsquo;t have any tooth-brush.</i></p>
<p><span class="sc">Senator Burrows</span>: &ldquo;Did he give that as
his reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Admiral Dewey</span>: &ldquo;Yes, he said &lsquo;I
have no tooth-brush.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They used to come aboard my ship and take my time, and finally I
would not see them at all, but turned them over to my staff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now the lack of a tooth-brush is hardly a valid excuse for not going
into battle, however great a convenience it may be in campaign. But the
absence of orders from your commanding officer stands on a very
different footing. Aguinaldo had not yet arrived. Three hundred years
of Spanish misgovernment and cruelty is not conducive to aversion to
fictitious excuses by the lowly in the presence of supreme authority.
The answer was amusingly uncandid, but disproved neither patriotism nor
intelligence.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo arrived at Hong Kong from Singapore a day or so after
Admiral Dewey had sailed for Manila. Of the battle of May 1st, no
detailed mention is essential here. Every schoolboy is familiar with
it. It will remain, as long as the republic lasts, a part of the
heritage of the nation. But the true glory of that battle, to my mind,
rests, not upon the circumstance that we have the Philippines, but upon
the tremendous fact that before it occurred the attitude of our State
Department toward an American citizen sojourning in distant lands and
becoming involved in difficulties there had long been, &ldquo;Why
didn&rsquo;t he stay at home? Let him stew in his own juice&rdquo;;
whereas, since then, to be an American has been more like it was in the
days of St. Paul to be a Roman citizen.</p>
<p>May 16th, our consul at Hong Kong, Mr. Wildman, succeeded in getting
the insurgent leader and his staff <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19"
href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>off for Manila on board the U.
S. S. <i>McCulloch</i> by authority of Admiral Dewey. Like his
colleague over at Singapore, Consul Wildman was bent on the r&ocirc;le
of Warwick. Admiral Dewey was quite busy there in Manila Bay the first
two or three weeks after the battle, but yielding to the letters of
Wildman, who meantime had constituted himself a kind of fiscal agent at
Hong Kong for the prospective revolution in the matter of the purchase
of guns and otherwise, the Admiral told the commanding officer of the
<i>McCulloch</i> that on his next trip to Hong Kong he might bring down
a dozen or so of the Filipinos there. The frame of mind they were in on
reaching Manila, as a result of the assurances of Pratt and Wildman, is
well illustrated by a letter the latter wrote Aguinaldo a little later
(June 25th) which is undoubtedly in keeping with what he had been
telling him earlier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Do not forget that the United States undertook this
war for the sole purpose of relieving the Cubans from the cruelties
under which they were suffering, and not for the love of conquest or
the hope of gain. <i>They are actuated by precisely the same feelings
for the Filipinos.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e1169src" href=
"#xd27e1169" name="xd27e1169src">5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>And at the time, they were.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Every American citizen who came in contact with the Filipinos
at the inception of the Spanish War, or at any time within a few months
after hostilities began,&rdquo; said General Anderson in an interview
published in the <i>Chicago Record</i> of February 24, 1900,
&ldquo;probably told those he talked with *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* that we
intended to free them from Spanish oppression. The general expression,
was &lsquo;We intend to whip the Spaniards and set you
free.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>McCulloch</i> arrived in Manila Bay with Aguinaldo
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>and his outfit, May 19th. Let Admiral Dewey tell
what happened then<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1191src" href=
"#xd27e1191" name="xd27e1191src">6</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Aguinaldo came to see me. I said, &ldquo;Well now, go
ashore there; we have got our forces at the arsenal at Cavite, go
ashore and start your army.&rdquo; He came back in the course of a few
hours and said, &ldquo;I want to leave here; I want to go to
Japan.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give it up, Don Emilio.&rdquo;
<i>I wanted his help, you know.</i> He did not sleep ashore that night;
he slept on board the ship. The next morning he went on shore, <i>still
inside my lines</i>, and began recruiting men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enterprises of great pith and moment have often turned awry and lost
the name of action for lack of a word spoken in season by a stout
heart. Admiral Dewey spoke the word, and Aguinaldo, his
prot&eacute;g&eacute;, did the rest. &ldquo;Then he began operations
toward Manila, and he did wonderfully well. He whipped the Spaniards
battle after battle *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"n48.2src" href="#n48.2" name="n48.2src">7</a> In fact, the desperate
bravery of those little brown men after they got warmed up reminds one
of the Japs at the walls of Peking, in the advance of the Allied Armies
to the relief of the foreign legations during the Boxer troubles of
1900. Admiral Dewey told the Senate Committee in 1902 that Aguinaldo
actually wanted to put one of the old smooth-bore Spanish guns he found
at Cavite <i>on a barge</i> and have him (Dewey) <i>tow it</i> up in
front of Manila so he could attack the city with it. &ldquo;I said,
&lsquo;Oh no, no; we can do nothing until our troops
come.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Otherwise he was constantly advising and encouraging him. Why? Let
the Admiral answer: &ldquo;I knew that what he was doing&mdash;driving
the Spaniards in&mdash;was <i>saving our troops</i>.&rdquo;<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n48.2">7</a> In other words they were daily
dying that American soldiers might live, on the faith of the reasons
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>for which we had declared war, and trusting,
because of the words of our consuls and the acts of our admiral, in the
sentiment subsequently so nobly expressed by Mr. McKinley in his
instructions to the Paris peace Commissioners:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The United States in making peace should follow the
same high rule of conduct which guided it in facing war.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1231src" href="#xd27e1231" name=
"xd27e1231src">8</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know what the action of our Government would
be,&rdquo; said the Admiral to the Committee,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1238src" href="#xd27e1238" name="xd27e1238src">9</a> adding that
he simply used his best judgment on the spot at the time; presumably
supposing that his Government would do the decent thing by these people
who considered us their liberators. &ldquo;They looked on us as their
liberators,&rdquo; said he.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1243src" href=
"#xd27e1243" name="xd27e1243src">10</a> &ldquo;Up to the time the army
came he (Aguinaldo) did everything I requested. He was most obedient;
whatever I told him to do he did. I saw him almost daily.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1248src" href="#xd27e1248" name=
"xd27e1248src">11</a> I had not much to do with him after the army
came.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1253src" href="#xd27e1253"
name="xd27e1253src">12</a></p>
<p>That was no ordinary occasion, that midsummer session of the Senate
Committee in 1902. It was a case of the powerful of the earth
discussing a question of ethics, even as they do in Boston. The nation
had been intoxicated in 1898 with the pride of power&mdash;power
revealed to it by the Spanish War; and in a spirit thus mellowed had
taken the Philippines as a sort of political foreign mission,
forgetting the injunction of the Fathers to keep Church and State
separate, but not forgetting the possible profits of trade with the
saved. A long war with the prospective saved had followed, developing
many barbarities avenged in kind, and the breezes from the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>South
Seas were suggesting the aroma of shambles. &ldquo;How did we get into
all this mess, anyhow?&rdquo; said the people. &ldquo;Let us pause, and
consider.&rdquo; Hear the still small voice of a nation&rsquo;s
conscience mingling with demagogic nonsense perpetrated by potent,
grave, and reverend Senators:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Admiral Dewey: &ldquo;I do not think it makes any
difference what my opinion is on these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Senator Patterson: &ldquo;There is no man whose opinion goes farther
with the country than yours does, Admiral, and therefore I think you
ought to be very prudent in expressing your views.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Senator Beveridge (Acting Chairman): &ldquo;The Chairman will not
permit any member to lecture Admiral Dewey on his prudence or
imprudence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This of course would read well to &ldquo;Mary of the Vine-clad
Cottage&rdquo; out in Indiana, whose four-year-old boy was named George
Dewey&mdash;, or to her counterpart up in Vermont who might name her
next boy after the brilliant and distinguished Acting Chairman, in
token of her choice for the Presidency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Senator Patterson: &ldquo;I was not lecturing
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Senator Beveridge: &ldquo;Yes; you said he ought to be
prudent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Senator Patterson: &ldquo;And I think it was well enough to suggest
those things.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1280src" href=
"#xd27e1280" name="xd27e1280src">13</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thawed into theorizing by these indubitably genuine evidences of a
nation&rsquo;s high regard, the man of action tried to help the nation
out. He said he had used the Filipinos as the Federal troops used the
negroes in the Civil War. Senator Patterson struck this suggestion
amidships and sunk it with the remark that the negroes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>were
expecting freedom. Admiral Dewey had said &ldquo;The Filipinos were
slaves too&rdquo; and considered him their liberator.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e1289src" href="#xd27e1289" name="xd27e1289src">14</a> But he
never did elaborate on the new definition of freedom which had followed
in the wake of his ships to Manila, viz., that Freedom does not
necessarily mean freedom from alien domination, but only a change of
masters deemed by the new master beneficial to the
&ldquo;slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apropos of why he accepted Aguinaldo&rsquo;s help, the Admiral also
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I was waiting for troops to arrive, and I felt sure
the Filipinos could not take Manila, and I thought that <i>the closer
they invested the city the easier it would be when our troops arrived
to march in</i>. The Filipinos were our friends, assisting us; they
were doing our work.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1302src" href=
"#xd27e1302" name="xd27e1302src">15</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asked as to how big a force Aguinaldo had under arms then and
afterwards, the Admiral said maybe 25,000, adding, by way of
illustration of the pluck, vim, and patriotism of his valuable new-made
friends, &ldquo;They could have had any number of <i>men</i>; it was
just a question of <i>arming</i> them. <i>They could have had the whole
population.</i>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1318src" href=
"#xd27e1318" name="xd27e1318src">16</a> Eleven months after that, when
we captured the first insurgent capital, Malolos, General MacArthur,
the ablest and one of the bravest generals we ever set to slaughtering
Filipinos, said to a newspaper man just after a bloody and of course
victorious fight: &ldquo;When I first started in against these rebels,
I believed that Aguinaldo&rsquo;s troops represented only a
faction.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>I did not like</i>,&rdquo; said this veteran
of three wars, who was always &ldquo;on the job&rdquo; in action out
there as elsewhere, &ldquo;<i>I did not like to believe that the
whole</i> population of Luzon *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* was opposed to us
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* but after having come thus far, and having been brought
much in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>contact with both <i>insurrectos</i> and
<i>amigos, I have been reluctantly compelled to believe that the
Filipino masses are loyal to Aguinaldo and the government which he
heads</i>&rdquo;.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1338src" href="#xd27e1338"
name="xd27e1338src">17</a></p>
<p>Is it at all unlikely that Admiral Dewey did in fact say of his
prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, the Filipinos, to an American visiting Manila
in January, 1899, three or four weeks before the war broke out,
&ldquo;Rather than make a war of conquest upon the Filipino people, I
would up anchor and sail out of the harbor.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e1352src" href="#xd27e1352" name="xd27e1352src">18</a></p>
<p>If Dewey and MacArthur were right, then, about the situation around
Manila in 1898, it was a case of an entire people united in an
aspiration, and looking to us for its fulfilment.</p>
<p>When the American troops reached the Philippines and perfected their
battle formations about Manila, and the order to advance was given,
they did &ldquo;march in,&rdquo; to use Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s
expression above quoted. But they did not let the Filipinos have a
finger in the pie. The conquest and retention of the islands had then
been determined upon. The Admiral&rsquo;s reasons for saddling his
prot&eacute;g&eacute; with a series of bloody battles and a long and
arduous campaign are certainly stated with the proverbial frankness of
the sailorman: &ldquo;I wanted his help, you know.&rdquo; But what was
Aguinaldo to get out of the transaction, from the Dewey point of view?
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;They wanted to get rid of the Spaniards. I do not think they
looked much beyond that,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1366src"
href="#xd27e1366" name="xd27e1366src">19</a> said the Admiral to the
Senate Committee. Let us see whether they did or not. Aguinaldo had
been shipped by the Honorable E. Spencer Pratt, Consul-General of the
United States at Singapore, from that point to Hong Kong on April 26th,
consigned to his fellow Warwick, the Honorable Rounseville Wildman,
Consul-General of the United States at the last-named place, and had
been received in due course by the consignee. May 5th, at Hong Kong,
the Filipino Revolutionary Committee had a meeting, the minutes of
which we subsequently came into possession of, along with other
captured insurgent papers. The following is an extract from those
minutes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Once the President [Aguinaldo] is in the Philippines
with his prestige, he will be able to arouse the masses to combat the
demands of the United States, if they should colonize that country, and
will drive them, the Filipinos, if circumstances render it necessary,
to a Titanic struggle for their independence, even if later they should
succumb to the weight of the yoke of a new oppressor. If Washington
proposes to carry out the fundamental principles of its Constitution,
<i>it is most improbable that an attempt will be made to colonize the
Philippines or annex them. It is probable then that independence will
be guaranteed.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e1376src" href=

</blockquote>
<p>The truth is that instead of leaving everything to the chance of our
continuing in the same unselfish frame of mind we were really in when
the Spanish-American War started, Aguinaldo and his people, not sure
but what in the wind-up they might even be thrown back upon the tender
mercies of Spain, played their cards <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>boldly and consistently
from the beginning with a view of organizing a <i>de facto</i>
government and getting it recognized by the Powers as such at the very
earliest practicable moment. They believed that the Lord helps those
who help themselves. They had anticipated our change of heart and
already had it discounted before we were aware of it ourselves. They
were already acting on the idea that eternal vigilance is the price of
liberty while public opinion in the United States concerning them was
in a chrysalis state, and trying to develop a new definition of Liberty
which should comport with the subjugation of distant island subjects by
a continental commonwealth on the other side of the world based on
representative government. The prospective subjects did not believe
that a legislature ten thousand miles away in which they had no vote
would ever give them a square deal about tariff and other laws dictated
by special interests. They had had three hundred years of just that
very sort of thing under Spain and instinctively dreaded continuance of
it. That their instincts did not deceive them, our later study of
Congressional legislation will show. The Filipinos had greatly pondered
their future in their hearts during the last twelve months of
Spain&rsquo;s colonial empire, watching her Cuban embarrassments with
eager eye.</p>
<p>Having seen the frame of mind in which they approached the contract
implied in Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s cheery words, &ldquo;Well now, go
ashore there and start your army,&rdquo; what were the facts of recent
history within the knowledge of both parties at the time? What had been
the screams of the American eagle, if any, concerning his moral
leadership of the family of unfeathered bipeds?</p>
<p>President McKinley&rsquo;s annual message to Congress <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>of
December, 1897,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1394src" href="#xd27e1394"
name="xd27e1394src">21</a> calling attention to conditions in Cuba as
intolerable, had declared that if we should intervene to put a stop to
them, we certainly would not make it the occasion of a land-grab. The
other nations said: &ldquo;We are from Missouri.&rdquo; But Mr.
McKinley said, &ldquo;forcible annexation&rdquo; was not to be thought
of by us. &ldquo;That by <i>our</i> code of morality would be
criminal,&rdquo; etc. So the world said, &ldquo;We shall see what we
shall see.&rdquo; Then had come the war message of April 11,
1898,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1402src" href="#xd27e1402" name=
"xd27e1402src">22</a> reiterating the declaration of the Cuban message
of December previous, that &ldquo;forcible annexation by <i>our</i>
code of morality would be criminal aggression.&rdquo; In other words we
announced to the overcrowded monarchies of the old world, whose
land-lust is ever tempted by the broad acres of South America, and ever
cooled by the virile menace of the Monroe doctrine, that we not only
were against the <i>principle</i> of land-grabbing, but would not
indulge in the <i>practice</i>. Immediately upon the conclusion of the
reading of the war message, Senator Stewart was recognized, and said,
among other things: &ldquo;Under the law of nations, intervention for
conquest is condemned, and is opposed to the universal sentiment of
mankind. It is unjust, it is robbery, to intervene for conquest.&rdquo;
Then Mr. Lodge stood up, &ldquo;in the Senate House a Senator,&rdquo;
and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We are there [meaning in this present Cuban situation]
because we represent the spirit of liberty and the spirit of the new
time, and Spain is over against us because she is medi&aelig;val,
cruel, dying. We have grasped no man&rsquo;s territory, we have taken
no man&rsquo;s property, we have invaded no man&rsquo;s rights. <i>We
do not ask their lands.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e1425src" href=
"#xd27e1425" name="xd27e1425src">23</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p>These speeches went forth to the world almost like a part of the
message itself. And Admiral Dewey, like every other American, in his
early dealings with Aguinaldo, after war broke out, must have assumed a
mental attitude in harmony with these announcements. But the world
said, &ldquo;All this is merely what you Americans yourselves call
&lsquo;hot air.&rsquo; We repeat, &lsquo;We are from
Missouri.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; Then we said: &ldquo;Oh very well, we
will show you.&rdquo; So in the declaration of war against Spain we
inserted the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Fourth: That the United States hereby disclaims any
disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or
control over said island except for the pacification thereof, and
asserts its determination when that is accomplished, to leave the
government and control of the island to its people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This meant, &ldquo;It is true we do love the Almighty Dollar very
dearly, oh, Sisters of the Family of Nations, but there are some
axiomatic principles of human liberty that we love better, and one of
them is the &lsquo;unalienable right&rsquo; of every people to pursue
happiness in their own way, free from alien domination.&rdquo; All
these things were well known to both the contracting parties when
Admiral Dewey set Aguinaldo ashore at Cavite, May 20, 1898, and got him
to start his insurrection &ldquo;under the protection of our
guns,&rdquo; as he expressed it.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1441src"
href="#xd27e1441" name="xd27e1441src">24</a> Accordingly, when the
insurgent leader went ashore, the declaration of war was his major
premise, the assurances of our consuls and the acts of our Admiral
pursuant thereto were his minor premise, and Independence was his
conclusion. Trusting to the faith and honor of the American people, he
took his life in his hands, left the panoplied safety of our mighty
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>squadron, and plunged, single-handed, into the
struggle for Freedom.</p>
<p>What was the state of the public mind on shore, and how was it
prepared to receive his assurances of American aid? Consider the
following picture in the light of its sombre sequel.</p>
<p>Just as the war broke out, Consul Williams had left Manila and gone
over to Hong Kong, where he joined Admiral Dewey, and accompanied him
back to Manila, and was thus privileged to be present at the battle of
Manila Bay, May 1st. Under date of May 12th, from his consular
headquarters aboard the U. S. S. <i>Baltimore</i>, he reports<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1455src" href="#xd27e1455" name=
"xd27e1455src">25</a> going ashore at Cavite and being received with
enthusiastic greetings by vast crowds of Filipinos. &ldquo;They crowded
around me,&rdquo; says Brother Williams, &ldquo;hats off, shouting
&lsquo;<i lang="es">Viva los Americanos</i>,&rsquo; thronged about me
by hundreds to shake either hand, even several at a time, men, women,
and children, striving to get even a finger to shake. So I moved
<i>half a mile</i>, shaking continuously with both hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tut! tut! says the casual reader. What did the Government at
Washington know of all these goings on, that it should be charged later
with having violated as binding a moral obligation as ever a nation
assumed? It is true that the news of the Williams ovation, as in the
case of the Pratt serenade, reached Washington only by the slow
channels of the mail. But Washington did in fact receive the said news
by due course of mail. When it came, however, Washington was nursing
visions of savages in blankets smoking the pipe of peace with the
agents of the Great White Father in the White House&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
thought, or hoped, the Filipinos were savages&mdash;and remained as
deaf to the sounds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30"
name="pb30">30</a>]</span>of the Williams ovation as it had been to the
strains of the Pratt serenade.</p>
<p>However, hardly had Admiral Dewey taken his binoculars from the gig
that carried Aguinaldo ashore to raise his auxiliary insurrection, when
he called his Flag Secretary, or the equivalent, and dictated the
following cablegram to the Secretary of the Navy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Aguinaldo, the rebel commander-in-chief, was brought
down by the <i>McCulloch</i>. Organizing forces near Cavite, and <i>may
render assistance that will be valuable</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1485src" href="#xd27e1485" name="xd27e1485src">26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds a little more serious than &ldquo;earnest boys&rdquo;
alleging the lack of a toothbrush as an excuse for declining mortal
combat, does it not? <i>How</i> valuable did this assistance prove?
Admiral Dewey had to wait three and one half months for the army to
arrive, and this is how the commanding general of the American forces
describes conditions as he found them in the latter part of August:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">For three and one half months Admiral Dewey with his
squadron and the insurgents on land had kept Manila tightly bottled.
All commerce had been interdicted, internal trade paralyzed, and food
supplies were nearly exhausted.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1498src"
href="#xd27e1498" name="xd27e1498src">27</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, he might have added, the taking of the city was thus made
perfectly easy. Otherwise, as Aguinaldo put it in one of his letters to
General Otis, we would not have taken a city, but only <i>the ruins</i>
of a city. Admiral Dewey said to the Senate Committee in 1902:
&ldquo;They [the Spaniards] surrendered on August 13th, and they had
not gotten a thing in after the 1st of May.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e1508src" href="#xd27e1508" name="xd27e1508src">28</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the early part of the next year, 1899, President McKinley sent
out a kind of olive-branch commission, of which President Schurman of
Cornell University was Chairman. The olive branch got withered in the
sulphur of exploding gun-powder, so the Commission contented itself
with making a report. And this is what they said concerning what
followed the Dewey-Aguinaldo <i>entente</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Shortly afterwards, the Filipinos began to attack the
Spanish. Their number was rapidly augmented by the militia who had been
given arms by Spain, all of whom revolted and joined the insurgents.
Great Filipino successes followed, many Spaniards were taken prisoners,
and while the Spanish troops now remained quietly in Manila, the
Filipino forces made themselves masters of <i>the entire island</i> [of
Luzon] except that city.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1525src" href=
"#xd27e1525" name="xd27e1525src">29</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of conditions in July, sixty days after Admiral Dewey had on May
20th said to Aguinaldo in effect, &ldquo;Go it, little man, we need you
in our business,&rdquo; Mr. Wildman, our Consul at Hong Kong, writing
to the State Department, said, in defending himself for his share in
the business of getting Aguinaldo&rsquo;s help under promises, both
express and implied, which were subsequently repudiated, that after he,
Wildman, put the insurgent chief aboard the <i>McCulloch</i>, May 16th,
bound for Manila to co-operate by land with our navy: &ldquo;He
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* organized a government *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and from that
day to this he has been uninterruptedly successful in the field and
dignified and just as the head of his government,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1535src" href="#xd27e1535" name=
"xd27e1535src">30</a> a statement which Admiral Dewey subsequently
endorsed.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1540src" href="#xd27e1540" name=
"xd27e1540src">31</a></p>
<p>We have seen the preliminaries of this &ldquo;government&rdquo;
started under the auspices of our Admiral and under <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>what he
himself called &ldquo;the protection of our guns&rdquo; (<i>ante</i>).
Let us note its progress. If you turn the leaves of the contemporaneous
official reports, you see quite a moving picture show, and the action
is rapid. On May 24th, still &ldquo;under the protection of our
guns,&rdquo; Aguinaldo proclaimed his revolutionary government and
summoned the people to his standard for the purpose of driving the
Spaniards out forever. The situation was an exact counterpart of the
cotemporary Cuban one as regards identity of purpose between
&ldquo;liberator&rdquo; and &ldquo;oppressed.&rdquo; His proclamation
promised a constitutional convention to be called later (and which
<i>was</i> duly called later) to elect a President and Cabinet, in
whose favor he would resign the emergency authority now assumed;
referred to the United States as &ldquo;undoubtedly
disinterested&rdquo; and as considering the Filipinos &ldquo;capable of
governing for ourselves our unfortunate country&rdquo;; and formally
announced the temporary assumption of supreme authority as dictator.
Copies of these proclamations were duly furnished Admiral Dewey. The
latter was too busy looking after the men behind his guns and watching
the progress of his plucky little ally to study Spanish, so he
forwarded them to the Navy Department without
comment&mdash;&ldquo;without reading them,&rdquo; said he to the Senate
Committee in 1902.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1555src" href=
"#xd27e1555" name="xd27e1555src">32</a> When his attention was called
to them before the Committee by one of the members reading them, his
comment was, &ldquo;Nothing about independence there, is
there?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1560src" href="#xd27e1560"
name="xd27e1560src">33</a> It seems to me it did not take an
international lawyer to see <i>a good deal</i> &ldquo;there,&rdquo;
about independence. In a proclamation published at Tarlac in the latter
part of 1899, which appears to have been a sort of swan-song of the
Philippine Republic, Aguinaldo had said, in effect, &ldquo;Certainly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>Admiral Dewey did not bring me from Hong Kong to
Manila to fight the Spaniards for the benefit of American Trade
Expansion,&rdquo; and in this proclamation he claimed that Admiral
Dewey promised him independence. It is true, that in a letter to
Senator Lodge, which that distinguished gentleman read on the floor of
the Senate on January 31, 1900, Admiral Dewey denounced this last
statement as false. It is also true that those Americans are few and
far between who will take Aguinaldo&rsquo;s word in preference to
Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s. Certainly the writer is not one of them. But
Aguinaldo is no Spanish scholar, being more of a leader of men than a
master of language, and what sort of an interpreter acted between him
and the Admiral does not appear. Certainly he never did get anything in
writing from Admiral Dewey. But after the latter brought him to Manila,
set him to fighting the common enemy, and helped him with guns and
otherwise in quickly organizing an army for the purpose, the Admiral
was at least put on inquiry as to just what Aguinaldo supposed he
<i>was</i> fighting for. What did the Admiral probably suppose? He told
the Senate Committee that the idea that they wanted independence
&ldquo;never entered his head.&rdquo; The roar of mighty guns seems to
have made it difficult for him to hear the prattlings of what
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s proclamations of the time called &ldquo;the
legitimate aspirations of a people.&rdquo; The milk in the cocoanut is
this: How could it ever occur to a great naval commander, such as
Admiral Dewey, familiar with the four quarters of the globe, that a
coterie of politicians at home would be so foolish as to buy a vast
straggly archipelago of jungle-covered islands in the South Seas which
had been a nuisance to every government that ever owned them? But let
us turn from the Senate Committee&rsquo;s studies of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>1902 to
the progress of the infant republic of 1898 at Cavite.</p>
<p>The same day the above proclamations of May 24th were issued, we
find Consul Williams, now become a sort of amphibious civilian aide to
Dewey, having his consular headquarters afloat, on the U. S. S.
<i>Baltimore</i>, of the squadron, writing the State Department,
describing the great successes of the insurgents, his various
conferences with Aguinaldo and the other leaders, and his own
activities in arranging the execution of a power of attorney whereby
Aguinaldo released to certain parties in Hong Kong $400,000 then on
deposit to his credit in a Hong Kong bank, for the purpose of enabling
them to pay for 3000 stand of arms bought there and expected to arrive
at Cavite on the morrow, and for other needed expenses of the
revolutionary movement. He says, in part: &ldquo;Officers have visited
me during the darkness of the night to inform <i>the fleet and me</i>
of their operations, and to report increase of strength. When General
Merritt arrives he will find large auxiliary land forces adapted to his
service and used to the climate.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1584src" href="#xd27e1584" name="xd27e1584src">34</a> Throughout
this period Admiral Dewey reports various cordial conferences with
Aguinaldo, though he is not so literary as to vivify his accounts with
allusions to the weather. In one despatch he states that he has
&ldquo;refrained from assisting him *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* with the forces
under my command&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1589src" href=
"#xd27e1589" name="xd27e1589src">35</a>&mdash;explaining to him that
&ldquo;the squadron could not act until the arrival of the United
States troops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six days after the issuance of the Dictatorship proclamations above
mentioned, viz., on May 30th, Admiral Dewey cables the Navy
Department<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1596src" href="#xd27e1596" name=
"xd27e1596src">36</a>: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35"
name="pb35">35</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Aguinaldo, revolutionary leader, visited
<i>Olympia</i> yesterday. He expects to make general attack May
31st.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He did not succeed entirely, but there was hard fighting, and the
cordon around the doomed Spaniards in Manila and its suburbs was drawn
ever closer and closer.</p>
<p>The remarkable feat of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s raising a right formidable
fighting force in twelve days after his little &ldquo;Return from
Elba,&rdquo; which force kept growing like a snowball, is difficult,
for one who does not know the Filipinos, and the conditions then, to
credit. It is explained by the fact that Admiral Dewey let him have the
captured guns in the Cavite arsenal, that Cavite was a populous hotbed
of insurrection, and that many native regiments, or parts of regiments,
quite suited to be the nucleus of an army, having lots of veteran
non-commissioned officers, deserted the Spaniards and went over to the
insurgents, their countrymen, as soon as Aguinaldo arrived.</p>
<p>On June 6th, we have another bulletin sent to the Navy Department by
Admiral Dewey, transmitting with perceptible satisfaction further
information as to the progress of his indefatigable
prot&eacute;g&eacute;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Insurgents have been engaged actively within the
province of Cavite during the last week; they have had several small
victories, taking prisoners about 1800 men, 50 officers; Spanish
troops, not native.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1618src" href=
"#xd27e1618" name="xd27e1618src">37</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Along about this period Aguinaldo happens to get hold of a belated
copy of the <i>London Times</i> of May 5, 1898. It contains
considerable speculation on the future of the Philippines which casts a
shadow over the soul of the president of the incipient republic.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>Having read President McKinley&rsquo;s immortal
State papers about the moral obliquity of &ldquo;forcible
annexation,&rdquo; he is moved to write direct to the source of those
noble sentiments. The letter is dated June 10, 1898. It is addressed,
with a quaintness now pathetic, &ldquo;To the President of the Republic
of the Great North American Nation.&rdquo; It greets the addressee with
&ldquo;the most tender effusion of&rdquo; the writer&rsquo;s soul,
expresses his &ldquo;deep and sincere gratitude,&rdquo; in the name of
his people, &ldquo;for the efficient and <i>disinterested</i>
protection which you have decided to give it to shake off the yoke of
the cruel and corrupt Spanish domination, as you are doing to the
equally unfortunate Cuba&rdquo; and then proceeds to tell of &ldquo;the
great sorrow which all of us Filipinos felt on reading in the
<i>Times</i> the astounding statement that you, sir, will retain these
islands,&rdquo; etc. He proceeds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The Philippine people *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* have seen in
your nation, ever since your fleet destroyed in a moment the Spanish
fleet which was here *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* <i>the angel who is the harbinger
of their liberty</i>; and they <i>rose like a single wave</i>
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* as soon as I trod these shores; and captured in ten
days nearly the whole garrison of this Province of Cavite <i>in whose
port I have my government&mdash;by the consent of the Admiral of your
triumphant fleet</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1649src" href=
"#xd27e1649" name="xd27e1649src">38</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The writer closes his letter with an impassioned protest against the
occurrence of what is suggested in the <i>Times</i>, and speaks of his
fellow-countrymen as &ldquo;a people which trusts blindly in you not to
abandon it to the tyranny of Spain, but to leave it free and
independent,&rdquo; and adds his &ldquo;fervent prayers for the
ever-increasing prosperity of your powerful nation.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1659src" href="#xd27e1659" name=
"xd27e1659src">39</a></p>
<p>But the signer of the foregoing letter did not spend <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>all his
time <i>praying</i> for us, as may be observed in this bulletin from
Admiral Dewey concerning the way he was lambasting the common enemy,
sent the Navy Department, June 12th:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Insurgents continue hostilities and have practically
surrounded Manila. They have taken 2500 Spanish prisoners, whom they
treat most humanely. They do not intend to attack city proper until the
arrival of United States troops thither; I have advised.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1674src" href="#xd27e1674" name=
"xd27e1674src">40</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Four days later Washington chided the hapless Pratt at Singapore
about having talked to Aguinaldo of &ldquo;direct co-operation&rdquo;
with Admiral Dewey, saying: &ldquo;To obtain the unconditional personal
assistance of General Aguinaldo in the expedition to Manila was proper,
if in so doing he was not induced to form hopes which it might not be
practicable to gratify.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1681src"
href="#xd27e1681" name="xd27e1681src">41</a> This communication goes on
to advise Mr. Pratt that the Department cannot approve anything he may
have said to Aguinaldo on behalf of the United States which would
concede that in accepting his co-operation we would owe him anything.
Yet it did not tell Admiral Dewey to quit coaching him, because <i>the
service he was rendering was too valuable</i>. There is no
communication to Admiral Dewey about &ldquo;hopes which it might not be
practicable to gratify&rdquo; in the official archives of those times.
There was Admiral Dewey coaching Aguinaldo and telling him to wait for
the main attack until General Merritt should arrive with our troops.
Why? Because he expected Merritt to co-operate with Aguinaldo, and of
course Aguinaldo expected exactly what Dewey expected.</p>
<p>In reviewing the history of those times the writer has not been so
careless as to have overlooked Senator <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>Lodge&rsquo;s elaborate
speech in the Senate on March 7, 1900, wherein attention is called to
the circumstance that a few days after Aguinaldo landed at Cavite, the
Navy Department cabled cautioning Dewey to have no alliance with him
that might complicate us, and that the Admiral answered he had made no
alliance and would make none. But if actions speak louder than words,
the Senator&rsquo;s point does not rise above the dignity of a
technicality.</p>
<p>The same day the State Department reprimanded Pratt, as above
indicated, viz., June 16th, Consul Williams at Manila wrote them a
glowing communication<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1695src" href=
"#xd27e1695" name="xd27e1695src">42</a> about how &ldquo;active and
almost uniformly successful&rdquo; Aguinaldo was continuing to be. But
no resultant enthusiasm is of record. Two days later, on June 18th,
Aguinaldo issued his first formal Declaration of Independence. The
infant republic was now less than a month old, but it already had a
fine set of teeth. The Spaniards had seen them. The proclamation was of
course addressed to the Filipino people, and called on them to rally to
the cause, but he was also driving at recognition by the Powers. It
read in part: &ldquo;In the face of the whole world I have proclaimed
that the aspiration of my whole life, the final object of all my wishes
and efforts, is your independence, because I have the inner conviction
that it is also your constant longing.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1700src" href="#xd27e1700" name="xd27e1700src">43</a> Many
Americans insist that this is mere &ldquo;hot air&rdquo; and that the
average Filipino peasant does not think much more than his plough
animal, the scoffer himself being stupidly unaware that this has been
precisely the argument of tyranny in all ages. But the pride a people
will have in seeing the best educated and most able men of their own
race in charge of their affairs seems to me too obvious to need
elaboration. It was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39"
name="pb39">39</a>]</span>always accepted by us as axiomatic until we
took the Philippines. It is a cruel species of wickedness for an
American to tell his countrymen that the Filipino people <i>do not
want</i> independence, for some of them may believe it.</p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence of June 18th is known to students of
Philippine political arch&aelig;ology as the Proclamation establishing
the &ldquo;dictatorial&rdquo; government. The principal thing it did
was to supplement the absolute dictatorship proclaimed May 24th by
provisions for organizing in detail. It also declared independence. A
more elaborate Declaration followed on June 23d, known as the
proclamation establishing the &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; government.
This made provision for a Congress, a Cabinet, and courts. Of course it
was only a paper government the day the ink dried on it. But we will
follow it through its teething, and adolescence, to the attainment of
its majority at an inauguration where the president was driven to the
place of the taking of the oath of office in a coach and four, through
a short and very self-respecting heyday, and a longer peripatetic
existence, to final dissolution. The document of June 23d reminds us of
a fact which in reading it at this late date we are apt to forget,
viz., that the Filipinos did not know at what moment their powerful
ally, the American squadron, might up anchor and sail away to the high
seas, to meet another Spanish fleet; thus leaving them to the tender
mercies of the Spaniards, possibly forever. So they were losing no
time. In fact, they had set to work from the very beginning with a
determination to try and secure recognition from the Powers at the
earliest moment. In appealing to the public opinion of the world with a
view of paving the way to recognition by the Powers&mdash;which
recognition would mean getting arms for war <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>with
Spain or any other power without the inconveniences of
filibustering&mdash;Aguinaldo says on behalf of his people in the
proclamation of June 23d, above mentioned, that they &ldquo;now no
longer limit themselves to asking for assimilation with the political
constitution of Spain, but ask for a complete separation (and) strive
for independence, completely assured that the time has come when they
can and ought to govern themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Frank D. Millet, who reached Manila soon enough (in July) to see
the ripples of this proclamation, describes the effect on the people.
While Mr. Millet is one of the best men that anybody ever knew, a
proposition as to which I am quite sure the President of the United
States and many people great and small in many lands would affirm my
judgment,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1716src" href="#xd27e1716" name=
"xd27e1716src">44</a> still, he writes from a frankly White Man&rsquo;s
Burden or land-grabbing standpoint&mdash;is in harmony with his
environment. At page 50 of his book,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1722src" href="#xd27e1722" name="xd27e1722src">45</a> he
reproduces the proclamation last above quoted from, and adds the
following satirical comment: &ldquo;This flowery production was widely
circulated and had a great effect on the imagination of the people,
who, in the elation of their present success in investing the town and
<i>in their belief that the United States was beginning a campaign in
the Philippines to free them from Spanish oppression</i> (italics mine)
shortly came to think that they were already a nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Copies of these June proclamations also, as in the case of those of
May 24th, were duly forwarded by Aguinaldo to Admiral Dewey<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1731src" href="#xd27e1731" name=
"xd27e1731src">46</a> and by him forwarded to Washington without
comment. In his letter transmitting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41"
href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>them to Dewey, Aguinaldo
announces that his government has &ldquo;<i>taken possession of the
various provinces of the archipelago</i>.&rdquo; Just exactly how many
provinces he had control of on June 23d will be examined later. <i>The
very same day the proclamation of June 23d declaring independence was
issued</i>, Admiral Dewey cabled the Navy Department<a class="noteref"
id="n69.1src" href="#n69.1" name="n69.1src">47</a>: &ldquo;Aguinaldo
has acted independently of the squadron, but <i>has kept me advised of
his progress which has been wonderful</i>. I have allowed him to take
from the arsenal such Spanish arms and ammunition as he needed.&rdquo;
After adding that &ldquo;Aguinaldo expects to capture Manila without
any assistance,&rdquo; the Admiral, evidently divining the temptation
that was then luring the political St. Anthonies at Washington,
volunteers this timely suggestion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">In my opinion these people are superior in
intelligence and more capable of self-government than the natives of
Cuba, and I am familiar with both races.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n69.1">47</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That there may be no doubt about the motive behind that suggestion,
it may be noted here that the Admiral told the Senate Committee in
1902: &ldquo;<i>I</i> wrote that <i>because I saw in the newspapers
that Congress contemplated giving the Cubans
independence</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1768src" href=
"#xd27e1768" name="xd27e1768src">48</a></p>
<p>But this is not all. On August 13th, the day after the Peace
Protocol was signed, Mr. McKinley wired Admiral Dewey asking about
&ldquo;the desirability of the several islands,&rdquo; the &ldquo;coal
<i>and mineral</i> deposits,&rdquo; and in reply on August 29th, the
Admiral wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">In a telegram sent the Department on June 23d, I
expressed the opinion that &ldquo;these people are far superior in
their intelligence and more capable of self-government than the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>natives of Cuba, and I am familiar with both
races.&rdquo; <i>Further intercourse with them has confirmed me in this
opinion.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e1786src" href="#xd27e1786"
name="xd27e1786src">49</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result of one year&rsquo;s stay in Cuba, and six in the
Philippines&mdash;two in the army that subjugated the Filipinos and
four as a judge over them&mdash;I heartily concur in the above opinion
of Admiral Dewey, but with this addition: Whatever of solidarity for
governmental purposes the Filipinos may have lacked at the date of the
Admiral&rsquo;s communications, they were certainly welded into
conscious political unity, <i>as one people</i>, in their war for
independence against us.</p>
<p>In the 1609 or Douay (pronounce Dewey) version of the Bible, the
Latin Vulgate, Luke&rsquo;s version of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer only
says &ldquo;Lead us not into temptation,&rdquo; while Matthew adds
&ldquo;but deliver us from evil.&rdquo; The Dewey suggestions to the
Washington Government in 1898 remind a regretful nation of both the
evangelical versions mentioned, for the first seems to say what Luke
says, and the second seems to add what Matthew adds.</p>
<p>There is not an American who has known the Filipinos since the
beginning of the American occupation who doubts for a moment that but
for our intervention a Republic would have been established out there
under the lead of Aguinaldo, Mabini, and their associates, which would
have compared well with the republican governments between the United
States and Cape Horn. The writer doubts very much if President Taft is
of a contrary opinion. The real issue is, now that we have them, should
we keep them in spite of the tariff iniquities which the Trusts
perpetrate on them through Congress, until they have received the best
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>possible tuition we can give them, or be content
to give them their independence when they are already at least as fit
for it as the Republics to the South of us, guaranteeing them
independence by international agreement like that which protects
Belgium and Switzerland?</p>
<p>Now why did Admiral Dewey repeat to his home government and
emphasize on August 29th a suggestion so extremely pertinent to the
capacity of the Filipinos for self-government which he had already made
in lucid language on June 23d previous? The answer is not far to seek.
General Anderson had arrived between the two dates, with the first
American troops that reached the islands after the naval battle of May
1st, and brought the Admiral the first intimation, which came somewhat
as a surprise of course, that there was serious talk in the United
States of retaining the Philippines. &ldquo;I was the first to tell
Admiral Dewey,&rdquo; says General Anderson in the <i>North American
Review</i> for February, 1900, &ldquo;that there was any disposition on
the part of the American people to hold the Philippines if they were
captured.&rdquo; He adds: &ldquo;Whether Admiral Dewey and Consuls
Pratt, Wildman, and Williams did or did not give Aguinaldo assurances
that a Filipino government would be recognized, the Filipinos certainly
thought so, judging from their acts rather than from their words.
Admiral Dewey gave them arms and ammunition, as I did subsequently at
his request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Anderson might have added that whenever the Admiral captured
prisoners from the Spaniards he would promptly turn them over to the
Filipinos&mdash;1300 at one clip in the month of June at
Olongapo.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1810src" href="#xd27e1810" name=
"xd27e1810src">50</a> These 1300 were men a German man-of-war prevented
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>the Filipinos from taking until Aguinaldo reported
the matter to Admiral Dewey, whereupon, he promptly sent Captain
Coghlan with the <i>Raleigh</i> and another of his ships to the scene
of the trouble, and Captain Coghlan said to the German
&ldquo;<span lang="de">Hoch der Kaiser</span>&rdquo; etc. or words to
that effect, and made him go about his business and let our ally alone.
Then Captain Coghlan took the 1300 prisoners himself and turned them
over to Aguinaldo by direction of Admiral Dewey. The motive for, as
well as the test of, an alliance, is that the other fellow can bring
into the partnership something you lack. The navy had no way to keep
prisoners of war. There can be no doubt that if Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s
original notions about meeting the problems presented by his great
victory of May 1, 1898, had been followed, we never would have had any
trouble with the Filipinos; nor can there be any doubt that he made
them his allies and used them as such. They were very obedient allies
at that, until they saw the Washington Government was going to
repudiate the &ldquo;alliance,&rdquo; and withhold from them what they
had a right to consider the object and meaning of the alliance, if it
meant anything.</p>
<p>The truth is, as Secretary of War Taft said in 1905, before the
National Geographic Society in Washington, &ldquo;We blundered into
colonization.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1826src" href=
"#xd27e1826" name="xd27e1826src">51</a> As we have seen, Admiral Dewey
repeatedly expressed the opinion, in the summer of 1898, that the
Filipinos were far superior in intelligence to the Cubans and more
capable of self-government. He of course saw quite clearly then, when
he was sending home those commendations of Filipino fitness for
self-government, just as we have all come to realize since, that a
coaling station would be; the main thing we should need in that part of
the world in time of war; that Manila, being quite away from the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>mainland of Asia, could never supersede Hong Kong
as the gateway to the markets of Asia, since neither shippers nor the
carrying trade of the world will ever see their way to unload cargo at
Manila by way of rehearsal before unloading on the mainland; and that
the taking of the islands was a dubious step from a financial
standpoint, and a still more dubious one from the strategic standpoint
of defending them by land, in the event of war with Japan, Germany, or
any other first-class power. At this late date, when the passions and
controversies of that period have long since subsided, is it not
perfectly clear that after he destroyed the Spanish fleet, Admiral
Dewey not only dealt with the Filipinos, until the army came out,
substantially as Admiral Sampson and General Shatter did with the
Cubans, but also that he did all he properly could to save President
McKinley from the one great blunder of our history, the taking of the
Philippine Islands? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46"

<p class="first">The destruction of the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay on
May 1, 1898, ten days after the outbreak of the war with Spain, having
necessitated sending troops to the Philippines to complete the
reduction of the Spanish power in that quarter, Major-General Wesley
Merritt was on May 16th selected to organize and command such an
expedition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The First Expedition,&rdquo; as it was always distinguished,
by the officers and men of the Eighth Army Corps, there having been
many subsequent expeditions sent out before our war with the Filipinos
was over, was itself subdivided into a number of different expeditions,
troops being hurried to Manila as fast as they could be assembled and
properly equipped in sufficient numbers. The first batch that were
whipped into shape left San Francisco under command of
Brigadier-General Thomas M. Anderson, on May 25th, and arrived off
Manila, June 30th. General Merritt did not arrive until July 25th. It
was General Anderson, therefore, who broke the ice of the American
occupation of the Philippines.</p>
<p>In his annual message to Congress of December, following,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1854src" href="#xd27e1854" name="xd27e1854src">1</a>
summing up the War with Spain and its <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>results, Mr. McKinley
gives a brief account of the First Expedition. After recounting Admiral
Dewey&rsquo;s victory of May 1st previous, he states that &ldquo;on the
seventh day of May the Government was advised officially of the victory
at Manila, and at once inquired of the commander of the fleet what
troops would be required.&rdquo; President McKinley does not give the
Admiral&rsquo;s answer, though he does state that it was received on
the 15th day of May. The Admiral&rsquo;s answer appears, however, in
the <i>Report of the Navy Department</i> for 1898, Appendix, page 98.
It was: &ldquo;In my best judgment, a well-equipped force of 5000
men.&rdquo; But the President&rsquo;s message does state that he at
once sent a &ldquo;total force consisting of 641 officers and 15,058
enlisted men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The difference of view-point of the Admiral and the President is
clear from the language of both. In recommending 5000 troops, the
Admiral had said they would be necessary &ldquo;to retain possession
[of Manila] and thus control Philippine Islands.&rdquo; This counted,
of course, on the friendship of the people, as in Cuba. &ldquo;I had in
view simply taking possession of the city.&rdquo; said Admiral Dewey to
the Senate Committee in 1902.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1866src" href=
"#xd27e1866" name="xd27e1866src">2</a></p>
<p>The purpose of the President in sending three times as many troops
as were needed for the purpose Admiral Dewey had in mind is indicated
in his account of what happened. After describing the taking of Manila
by our troops on August 13th, the presidential message says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">By this <i>the conquest of the Philippine Islands</i>,
virtually accomplished when the Spanish capacity for resistance was
destroyed by Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s victory of May 1st, <i>was formally
sealed</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1883src" href="#xd27e1883" name=
"xd27e1883src">3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span></p>
<p>Admiral Dewey contemplated that we should merely remain masters of
the situation out where he was until the end of the war. President
McKinley set about to effect &ldquo;the conquest of the Philippine
Islands.&rdquo; The naval victory of Manila Bay having made it certain
that at the conclusion of our war against a decadent monarchy we would
at last have an adequate coaling station and naval base in the Far
East, the sending of troops to the Philippines, in appropriate
prosecution of the war, to reduce and capture Manila, the capital and
chief port, raised the question at once &ldquo;And then
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The genesis of the idea of taking over the archipelago is traceable
to within a few days after the destruction of the Spanish fleet.</p>
<p>Within a few days after the official news of the battle of Manila
Bay reached Washington, the Treasury Department set a man to work
making a &ldquo;Report on Financial and Industrial Conditions of the
Philippine Islands.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1895src" href=
"#xd27e1895" name="xd27e1895src">4</a> The Interior Department also
awoke, about the same time to possibilities of an El Dorado in the new
overseas conquest. &ldquo;In May, 1898,&rdquo; says Secretary of the
Interior, C. N. Bliss, in a letter intended for the Peace Commissioners
who met at Paris that fall, &ldquo;by arrangement between the Secretary
of War with this Department&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Bliss&rsquo;s grammar is
bad, but his meaning is plain&mdash;&ldquo;a geologist of the United
States Geological Survey accompanied the military expedition to the
Philippines for the purpose of procuring information touching the
geological <i>and mineral</i> resources of said
islands.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1903src" href="#xd27e1903"
name="xd27e1903src">5</a> This report, which accompanies the Bliss
letter, reads like a mining stock prospectus. That summer an Assistant
Secretary of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>Treasury, presumably echoing the sentiments of the
Administration, came out in one of the great magazines of the period,
the <i>Century</i>, with an article in which he said: &ldquo;We see
with sudden clearness that some of the most revered of our political
maxims have outlived their force. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* A new mainspring
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* has become the directing force *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* the
mainspring of commercialism.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1913src"
href="#xd27e1913" name="xd27e1913src">6</a> Of course, the writer did
not mention that Manila is an out-of-the-way place, so far as regards
the main-travelled routes across the Pacific Ocean, and also forgot
that, as has been suggested once before, the carrying trade of the
world, and the shippers on which it depends, in the contest of the
nations for the markets of Asia, would never take to the practice of
unloading at Manila by way of rehearsal, before finally discharging
cargo on the mainland of Asia, where the name of the Ultimate Consumer
is legion. Nevertheless &ldquo;Expansion&rdquo;&mdash;of Trade,
mainly&mdash;was the slogan of the hour, and any one who did not catch
the contagion of exuberant allusion to &ldquo;Our New
Possessions&rdquo; was considered crusty and out of date. People who
referred back to the political maxims of Washington&rsquo;s Farewell
Address, and the cognate set represented by the Monroe Doctrine, were
regarded merely as not knowing a good thing when they saw it. So on
rode the country, on the crest of the wave of war. When President
McKinley sent the troops to the Philippines, their job was to hurry up
and effect what his subsequent message to Congress describing their
work called &ldquo;the conquest of the Philippine Islands.&rdquo; That
is, they were to effect a <i>constructive</i> conquest of the
archipelago before Spain should sue for peace. It never seemed to occur
to anybody at home that the Filipinos would object. If the country had,
through some divine interposition, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50"
href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>gotten it into its head that the
Filipinos were quite a decent lot and really did object very bitterly,
it would have risen in its wrath and smitten down any suggestion of
forcing a government on them against their will. But nobody knew
anything about them. They were a wholly new proposition.</p>
<p>General Anderson was of course furnished with a copy of the
President&rsquo;s instructions to his chief, General Merritt. They are
quite long, and go into details about a number of administrative
matters that would necessarily come up after the city should surrender,
such as the raising of revenue, the military commander&rsquo;s duty
under the law of nations with regard to the seizure of transportation
lines by land or sea, the protection of places of worship from
desecration or destruction, and the like. The only portion of them that
is essential to a clear understanding of subsequent events is now
submitted: They are dated Executive Mansion, May 18, 1898, and read in
part<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1927src" href="#xd27e1927" name=

<blockquote>
<p class="first">PRESIDENT McKINLEY&rsquo;S INSTRUCTIONS TO GENERAL
MERRITT</p>
<p>The destruction of the Spanish fleet at Manila, followed by the
taking of the naval station at Cavite, the paroling of the garrisons,
and acquisition of control of the bay, have rendered it necessary, in
the further prosecution of the measures adopted by this Government for
the purpose of bringing about an honorable and durable peace with
Spain, to send an army of occupation to the Philippines for <i>the
twofold purpose</i> of completing the reduction of the Spanish power in
that quarter, and of <i>giving order and security</i> to the islands
while in the possession of the United States.</p>
<p>For the command of this expedition I have designated Major-General
Wesley Merritt, and it now becomes my duty to give instructions as to
the manner in which the movements shall be conducted. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>The first effect of the military occupation of the enemy&rsquo;s
territory is the severance of the former political relations of the
inhabitants and the establishment of a new political power. Under this
changed condition of things the inhabitants, so long as they perform
their duties, are entitled to security in their persons and property
and in all their private rights and relations. It is my desire that the
people of the Philippines should be acquainted with the purpose of the
United States to discharge to the fullest extent its obligations in
this regard. It will therefore be the duty of the commander of the
expedition, <i>immediately upon his arrival</i> in the islands, to
publish a proclamation declaring that we come not to make war upon the
people of the Philippines nor upon any party or <i>faction</i> among
them, but to protect them in their homes, in their employments, and in
their personal and religious rights. All persons who, either by active
aid or by honest submission, co-operate with the United States in its
efforts to give effect to this beneficent purpose will receive the
reward of its support and protection. Our occupation should be as free
from severity as possible. Though <i>the powers of the military
occupant are absolute and supreme and operate immediately upon the
political condition of the inhabitants</i>, the municipal laws of the
conquered territory, such as affect private rights of persons and
property and provide for the punishment of crime, are to be considered
as continuing in force, so far as they are compatible with the new
order of things, until they are suspended or superseded by the
occupying belligerents; and in practice they are not usually abrogated,
but are allowed to remain in force and to be administered by the
ordinary tribunals substantially as they were before the occupation.
This enlightened practice is, so far as possible, to be adhered to on
the present occasion. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The freedom of the people to
pursue their accustomed occupations will be abridged only when it may
be necessary to do so.</p>
<p>While the rule of conduct of the American commander-in-chief will be
such as has just been defined, it will be his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>duty to
adopt measures of a different kind if, unfortunately, the course of the
people should render such measures indispensable to the maintenance of
law and order. He will then possess the power to replace or expel the
native officials in part or altogether, to substitute new courts of his
own constitution for those that now exist, or to create such
supplementary tribunals as may be necessary. In the exercise of these
high powers the commander must be guided by his judgment and experience
and a high sense of justice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this document declares the purpose of our government to be a
&ldquo;two fold purpose,&rdquo; viz., first, to make an appropriate
move in the game of war, and, second, to police the Islands
&ldquo;while in the possession of the United States,&rdquo; it is
wholly free from inherent evidence of any intention out of harmony with
the policy as to Cuba. In fact when the city of Santiago de Cuba
surrendered to our forces in July thereafter, and it became necessary
to issue instructions for the guidance of the military commander there,
exactly the same instructions were given him,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1965src" href="#xd27e1965" name="xd27e1965src">8</a> <i lang=
"la">verbatim et literatim</i>. But in respect of the Cuban
instructions there was never any concealment practised or necessary
because the Cubans had been assured by the Teller amendment to the
resolutions declaring war against Spain that we had no ulterior designs
on their country, and that, as soon as peace and public order were
restored, we intended &ldquo;to leave the government and control of the
island to its people.&rdquo; The Cuban instructions were therefore
frankly and promptly published in General Orders No. 101 by the War
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>Department, July 18, 1898, five days after they
were received from the President, and were then translated into Spanish
and spread broadcast over Santiago province without unnecessary delay.
I remember poring over a Spanish copy of General Orders 101, at
Santiago de Cuba, shortly after the fall of that city, which copy was
one of many already posted about that city by direction of General
Wood. The words &ldquo;the powers of the military occupant are
<i>absolute and supreme and operate immediately upon the political
condition of the inhabitants</i>&rdquo; never disturbed the Cuban
leaders in the least, because they were read in the light of the
disclaimer contained in the declaration of war. On the other hand, the
proclamation which the military commander in the Philippines was
enjoined by his instructions to publish &ldquo;immediately upon his
arrival in the islands,&rdquo; which arrival occurred July 25th, was
not so published until after we had taken Manila, August 13th, and then
it copied only the glittering generalities of the instructions
themselves, such as the part assuring the people that we had not come
to make war on them and that vested rights would be respected, but it
carefully omitted the words about the powers of the military occupant
being absolute and supreme, because when the army arrived it found a
native government that had already issued its declaration of
independence, was making wonderful progress against the common enemy,
and was able to put up a right good fight against us also, in case we
should deny them independence.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1979src"
href="#xd27e1979" name="xd27e1979src">9</a></p>
<p>General Anderson arrived in Manila Bay, June 30, 1898, with about
2500 men, and when General Merritt arrived, July 25th, we had about
10,000 all told, while the Filipinos had half again that many, and
there were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>12,000 Spanish soldiers in Manila. General
Anderson had not been long camped on the bayshore, under cover of the
Navy&rsquo;s guns and in the neighborhood of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
headquarters, before he understood the whole situation clearly and
wrote the War Department as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Since reading the President&rsquo;s instructions to
General Merritt, I think I should state to you that the establishment
of a provisional government on our part will probably bring us in
conflict with insurgents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter is dated July 18, 1898.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1995src" href="#xd27e1995" name="xd27e1995src">10</a></p>
<p>When General Anderson arrived in the islands on June 30th, the
Washington Government was still wrestling with the angel of its
announced creed about &ldquo;Forcible Annexation&rdquo; being
&ldquo;criminal aggression,&rdquo; and Mr. McKinley had to get both
that angel&rsquo;s shoulders on the mat and put him out of business
before he could get his own consent to giving any instructions to his
generals which might sanction their killing people for objecting to
forcible annexation. Hence his early anxiety to avoid a rupture with
the Filipino leaders. The first stage of this wrestling coincides in
point of time with General Anderson&rsquo;s tenure as the ranking
military officer commanding our forces in the Philippines, which was
from June 30th until the date of General Merritt&rsquo;s arrival, July
25th. As already made plain, the President&rsquo;s instructions for the
guidance of the military commander were entirely free from any
land-grabbing suggestion. On the other hand, when General Anderson left
San Francisco for Manila, May 25th, there was already talk in the
United States about retaining the Islands, if they were captured, for
he so informed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>Admiral Dewey in the first interview they had
after the transports which brought his command cast anchor near our
squadron in Manila Bay on the last day of June. &ldquo;I was the first
to tell Admiral Dewey,&rdquo; says he, in the <i>North American
Review</i> for February, 1900, &ldquo;that there was any disposition on
the part of the American people to hold the Philippines, if they were
captured. The current opinion was setting that way when the
expeditionary force left San Francisco, but this the Admiral had no
reason to surmise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Relegated by the circumstances to his own discretion as to how he
should act until Washington knew its mind, General Anderson&rsquo;s
attitude in the outset represented a &ldquo;peace-at-any-price&rdquo;
policy, suffused with benevolent pride at championing the cause of the
oppressed, but secretly knowing from the beginning that it might become
necessary later to slaughter said &ldquo;oppressed,&rdquo; should they
seriously object to a change of masters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On July 1st,&rdquo; says General Anderson, in the <i>North
American Review</i> article above quoted, &ldquo;I called on Aguinaldo
with Admiral Dewey.&rdquo; Of the Admiral&rsquo;s dealings with the
insurgent chief prior to this time, the General says in this same
article:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether Admiral Dewey and Consuls Pratt, Wildman, and
Williams did or did not give Aguinaldo assurances that a Filipino
government would be recognized, the Filipinos certainly thought so,
probably <span class="corr" id="xd27e2016" title=
"Source: infering">inferring</span> this from their acts rather than
from their statements.&rdquo; This last quoted passage was read to
Admiral Dewey by a member of the Senate Committee in 1902, along with
other parts of the magazine article cited, and he was asked to comment
on the same. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are General Anderson&rsquo;s statements. They
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>are very interesting, indeed; I am here to make my
own statements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had stated that he never did specifically promise Aguinaldo
independence, and the questioner was trying to show that his
<i>acts</i> had amounted to assurances and therefore had committed the
Government to giving the Filipinos their independence. Then Senator
Patterson began another question, and had gotten as far as &ldquo;I
want to know whether your views&mdash;&rdquo; when out came this, as of
a sailor-man clearing decks for action:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not like your questions a bit. I did not like them
yesterday and I do not like them to-day.&rdquo; So the Admiral&rsquo;s
feelings were respected and the question was not pressed. There is no
doubt at all that in the Philippines in the summer of 1898 the army
turned the back of its hand to Aguinaldo as soon as it got there and
baldly repudiated what the navy had done in the way of befriending the
Filipinos. But both had acted under the authority of the
Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy&mdash;the President. The
Admiral&rsquo;s sensitiveness on the subject <i>ought</i> to have been
respected. And it was.</p>
<p>By the time Admiral Dewey and General Anderson decided to call on
&ldquo;Don Emilio,&rdquo; the day after the General&rsquo;s arrival,
the unexpected intimations which the latter brought, as to the
Washington programme for the Philippine revolutionists being different
from that as to Cuba, had begun to get in its work on the former. Not
being a politician, the gallant Admiral was there ready and able to
carry out any orders his government might send him, whenever the
politicians should decide what they wanted to do. But in the absence of
orders, he began to trim his sails a bit, so as to be prepared for
whatever might be the policy. Accordingly, before he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>and the
General started out to pay their call on &ldquo;Don Emilio Aguinaldo y
Famy, President of the Revolutionary Government of the Philippines and
General in Chief of its Army&rdquo;&mdash;as he had styled himself in
his proclamation of June 23d,&mdash;the Admiral said, &ldquo;Do not
take your sword or put on your uniform, but just put on your blouse. Do
not go with any ceremony.&rdquo; And says he, in telling this,
&ldquo;We went in that way.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2038src"
href="#xd27e2038" name="xd27e2038src">11</a> The reason of thus
avoiding too much ceremony toward our &ldquo;ally&rdquo; claiming to
represent an existing government which had lately declared its
independence, is explained by an expression of the Admiral&rsquo;s
concerning said Declaration of Independence itself: &ldquo;That was my
idea, not taking it seriously.&rdquo; At that same hearing the Admiral
explained with much genuine feeling that from the day of the naval
battle of May 1st until the arrival of the army &ldquo;these great
questions&rdquo; were coming up constantly and he simply met them as
they arose by acting on his best judgment on the spot at the time. But
what a terrible mistake it was not to take that Declaration of
Independence of June 23d, seriously, backed as it was by an army of
15,000 men flushed with victory, and under the absolute control of the
author of the Declaration! Of course the Declaration had been published
to the army. Could its author have checked them by repudiating it even
if he had wanted to? As Aguinaldo himself expressed what would happen
in such a contingency, &ldquo;They would fail to recognize me as <i>the
interpreter of their aspirations</i> and would punish me as a traitor,
replacing me by another more careful of his own honor and
dignity.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2046src" href="#xd27e2046"
name="xd27e2046src">12</a></p>
<p>This Dewey-Anderson call on Aguinaldo was on July 1st. Admiral Dewey
now began to foresee that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href=
"#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>the Washington programme was going to
put him in an awkward position. So he began to take Aguinaldo more
seriously. On July 4th, he wired Washington: &ldquo;Aguinaldo
proclaimed himself President of the Revolutionary Republic on July
1st.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2055src" href="#xd27e2055" name=
"xd27e2055src">13</a> It was on July 7th that Admiral Dewey captured
1300 armed Spanish prisoners, the garrison of Isla la Grande, off
Olongapo, and turned them over to the forces of the Aguinaldo
government because he had no way to keep them.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2060src" href="#xd27e2060" name="xd27e2060src">14</a> Was not
that taking that government a bit seriously? How wholly unauthorized by
the facts was this of &ldquo;not taking it seriously,&rdquo; on the
part of &ldquo;The Liberator of the Filipinos,&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e2069src" href="#xd27e2069" name="xd27e2069src">15</a> the
immortal victor of Manila Bay, who two months before had taught the
nation the magnitude of its power for good, in a cause as righteous as
the crusades of old, and more sensible!</p>
<p>But to return to General Anderson&rsquo;s account in the <i>North
American Review</i> of his call, with Admiral Dewey, on the insurgent
chief: &ldquo;He asked me at once whether the &lsquo;United States of
the North&rsquo; either had, or would recognize his government. I am
not quite sure as to the form of the question, whether it was
&lsquo;had&rsquo; or &lsquo;would&rsquo;? <i>In either form it was
embarrassing.</i>&rdquo; General Anderson then tells of
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s returning his call: &ldquo;A few days thereafter he
made an official call, coming with cabinet, staff, and band. He asked
if we, the North Americans, as he called us, intended to hold the
Philippines as dependencies. I said I could not answer that, but that
in 122 years we had established no colonies. He then made this
remarkable statement: &lsquo;<i>I have studied attentively the
Constitution of the United <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href=
"#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>States, and I find in it no authority
for colonies, and I have no fear.</i>&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; General
Anderson adds: &ldquo;It may seem that my answer was evasive, but I was
at the time trying to contract with the Filipinos for horses, fuel, and
forage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this history must not lapse into an almanac, it may not be
amiss to follow these early stages of this matter through a few more
successive dates, because the history of that period was all indelibly
branded into Filipino memory shortly afterward with the red-hot iron of
war.</p>
<p>July 4th, General Anderson writes the Filipino candidate for
Independence inviting him to &ldquo;co-operate with us in military
operations against the Spanish forces.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2091src" href="#xd27e2091" name="xd27e2091src">16</a> This was
written not to arrange any <i>plan</i> of co-operation but in order to
get room about Cavite as a military base without a row. In his <i>North
American Review</i> article General Anderson says that on that same
day, the Fourth of July, Aguinaldo was invited to witness a parade and
review &ldquo;in honor of our national holiday.&rdquo; &ldquo;He did
not come,&rdquo; says the article, &ldquo;because he was not invited as
President but as General Aguinaldo.&rdquo; An odd situation, was it
not? Here was a man claiming to be President of a newly established
republic based on the principles set forth in our Declaration of
Independence, which republic had just issued a like Declaration, and he
was invited to come and hear <i>our</i> declaration read, and declined
<i>because we would not <span class="corr" id="xd27e2107" title=
"Source: recognise">recognize</span> his right to assert the same
truths</i>. On subsequent anniversaries of the day in the Philippines
it was deemed wise simply to prohibit the reading of our Declaration
before gatherings of the Filipino people. It saved discussion.</p>
<p>July 6th, General Anderson writes telling Aguinaldo <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>that he
is expecting more troops soon and therefore &ldquo;<i>I would like to
have your excellency&rsquo;s advice and
co-operation.</i>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2118src" href=
"#xd27e2118" name="xd27e2118src">17</a></p>
<p>July 9th, General Anderson writes the War Department that Aguinaldo
tells him he has about 15,000 fighting men, 11,000 armed with guns, and
some 4000 prisoners,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2125src" href=
"#xd27e2125" name="xd27e2125src">18</a> and adds: &ldquo;When we first
landed he seemed very suspicious, and not at all friendly but I have
now come to a better understanding with him and he is much more
friendly and seems <i>willing to co-operate</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>July 13th, we find Admiral Dewey also still in a co-operative mood.
On that day he cables the Navy Department of the capture of the 1,300
prisoners on July 7th, mentioned above, which capture was made, it
appears, because Aguinaldo complained to him that a German war-ship was
interfering with his operations,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2133src"
href="#xd27e2133" name="xd27e2133src">19</a> the prisoners being at
once turned over to Aguinaldo, as stated above.</p>
<p>July 18th, is the date of the letter to the War Department in which
General Anderson states that the establishment of a provisional
government by us will probably mean a conflict with the insurgents.
This was equivalent to saying that they will probably be ready to fight
whenever we assert the &ldquo;absolute and supreme&rdquo; authority
that the President&rsquo;s instructions had directed to be asserted by
the army as soon as it should arrive in the Philippines. Yet in the
fall of 1899, President McKinley said he &ldquo;never dreamed&rdquo;
that Aguinaldo&rsquo;s &ldquo;little band&rdquo; would oppose our rule
to the extent of war against it. It would have been more accurate if
the martyred Christian gentleman who used those words had said he
&ldquo;always hoped&rdquo; they would not, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>instead
of &ldquo;never dreamed&rdquo; they would. This letter of July 18th,
informs the Department:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Aguinaldo has declared himself dictator and
self-appointed president. He has declared martial law and promulgated a
minute method of procedure under it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>July 19th, General Anderson sends Major (now Major-General) J. F.
Bell, to Aguinaldo, and asks of him a number of favors, such as any
soldier may properly ask of an ally, for example, permission to see his
military maps, etc., and that Aguinaldo &ldquo;place at his
[Bell&rsquo;s] disposal any <i>information you may have</i> on the
above subjects, and also give him [Bell] a letter or pass addressed to
your subordinates which will <i>authorize them to furnish him any
information they can</i> *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and to facilitate his passage
along the lines, upon a reconnaissance around Manila, on which I
propose to send him.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2158src" href=
"#xd27e2158" name="xd27e2158src">20</a> All of which Aguinaldo did.</p>
<p>Military training is very keen on honor. Talk about what the French
call <i lang="fr">foi d&rsquo;officier</i>,&mdash;the &ldquo;word of an
officer&rdquo;! Did ever a letter from one soldier to another more
completely commit the faith and honor of his government, to recognition
of the existence of an alliance? &ldquo;In 122 years we have
established no colonies,&rdquo; he had told Aguinaldo. &ldquo;It looks
like we are about to go into the colonizing business,&rdquo; he had, in
effect, said to Admiral Dewey, about the same time.</p>
<p>July 21st, General Anderson writes the Adjutant-General of the army
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Since I last wrote, Aguinaldo has put in operation an
elaborate system of military government. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* It may seem
strange that I have made no formal protest against his proclamation as
dictator, his declaration of martial law, etc. I wrote such a protest
but did not publish it at Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s request.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2174src" href="#xd27e2174" name=
"xd27e2174src">21</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p>When he wrote this letter, General Anderson was evidently beginning
to have some compunctions about the trouble he now saw ahead. He was a
veteran of the Civil War, whose gallantry had then been proven on many
a field against an enemy compared with whom these people would be a
picnic. But things did not look to the grim old hero like there was
going to be a square deal. So he put this in the letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I submit, with all deference, that we have heretofore
underrated the natives. They are <i>not</i> ignorant savage tribes, but
have a civilization of their own, and although insignificant in
appearance are fierce fighters and for a tropical people they are
industrious. A small detail of natives will do more work than a
regiment of volunteers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this slam at &ldquo;volunteers&rdquo; <i>was</i> a bit
rough. But the battle-scarred veteran&rsquo;s sense of fair play was
getting on his nerves. He foresaw the coming conflict, and though he
did not shirk it, he did not relish it. He understood the
&ldquo;game,&rdquo; and it seemed to him the cards were stacked, to
meet the necessity of demonstrating that forcible annexation, instead
of being criminal aggression, was merely Trade Expansion, and that his
government was right then irrevocably committing itself, without any
knowledge of, or acquaintance with, the Filipinos, to the assumption
that they were incapable of running a government of their own.</p>
<p>The next day, July 22d, General Anderson wrote Aguinaldo a letter
advising him that he was without orders as yet concerning the question
of recognizing his government. But that this letter was neither a
protest nor in the nature of a protest, is evident from its text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I observe that Your Excellency has announced yourself
dictator and proclaimed martial law. As I am here <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>simply
in a military capacity, I have no authority to recognize such an
assumption. <i>I have no orders from my government on the
subject.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e2203src" href="#xd27e2203"
name="xd27e2203src">22</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet General Anderson&rsquo;s letter to the Adjutant-General of the
army of July 18th<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2210src" href="#xd27e2210"
name="xd27e2210src">23</a> uses the words &ldquo;since reading the
President&rsquo;s instructions to General Merritt,&rdquo; etc., showing
that he had a copy of them; and those instructions order and direct
(see <i>ante</i>) that as soon as the commanding general of the
American troops arrives he is to let the Filipinos know that &ldquo;the
powers of the military occupant are <i>absolute and supreme and
immediately operate</i> upon the political condition of the
inhabitants.&rdquo; A charitable view of the matter would be that,
technically, those were Merritt&rsquo;s orders, not Anderson&rsquo;s.
But the whole scheme was to conceal the intention to assume supreme
authority and keep Aguinaldo quiet &ldquo;until,&rdquo; as General
Merritt afterwards expressed it in his report, &ldquo;I should be in
possession of the city of Manila, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* as I would not until
then be in a position to *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* enforce my authority, in the
event that his [Aguinaldo&rsquo;s] pretensions should clash with my
designs.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2221src" href="#xd27e2221"
name="xd27e2221src">24</a></p>
<p>The same day that General Anderson wrote Aguinaldo his <i>billet
doux</i> about the dictatorship, viz., July 22d, he cabled Washington a
much franker and more serious message; which read: &ldquo;Aguinaldo
declares dictatorship and martial law over all islands. <span class=
"sc">The people expect independence.</span>&rdquo; The very next day,
July 23d, he wrote Aguinaldo asking his assistance in getting five
hundred horses, and fifty oxen and ox-carts, and manifesting
considerable impatience that he had not already complied with a
<span class="corr" id="xd27e2235" title=
"Source: similiar">similar</span> request previously <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>made
&ldquo;<i>as it was to fight in the cause of your
people</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2244src" href=
"#xd27e2244" name="xd27e2244src">25</a> The following day, July 24th,
replying to General Anderson&rsquo;s letter of the 22d wherein General
Anderson had advised him that he was as yet without orders concerning
the question of recognizing his government, Aguinaldo wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">It is true that my government has not been
acknowledged by any of the foreign powers, but we expected that the
great North American nation, which had struggled first for its
independence, and afterwards for the abolition of slavery, <i>and is
now actually struggling for the independence of Cuba</i>, would look
upon it with greater benevolence than any other nation.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2255src" href="#xd27e2255" name=
"xd27e2255src">26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That cablegram of July 22d, above quoted, in which the commanding
general of our forces in the Philippines advises the Washington
government, &ldquo;The people expect independence,&rdquo; is the
hardest thing in the published archives of our government covering that
momentous period for those who love the memory of Mr. McKinley to get
around.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2262src" href="#xd27e2262" name=
"xd27e2262src">27</a> After the war with the Filipinos broke out Mr.
McKinley said repeatedly in public speeches, &ldquo;I never dreamed
they would turn against us.&rdquo; You do not find the Anderson
cablegram of July 22d in the published report of the War Department
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>covering the period under consideration. General
Anderson addressed it to the Secretary of War and signed it, and,
probably for lack of army cable facilities, got Admiral Dewey to send
it to the Secretary of the Navy for transmission to the Secretary of
War.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2273src" href="#xd27e2273" name=
"xd27e2273src">28</a> Certain it must be that at some Cabinet meeting
on or after July 22, 1898, either the Secretary of the Navy or the
Secretary of War read in the hearing of the President and the rest of
his advisers that message from General Anderson, &ldquo;<span class=
"sc">The people expect independence.</span>&rdquo; The object here is
<i>not</i> to inveigh against Mr. McKinley. It is to show that, as
Gibbon told us long ago, in speaking of the discontent of far distant
possessions and the lack of hold of the possessor on the affections of
the inhabitants thereof, &ldquo;the cry of remote distress is ever
faintly heard.&rdquo; The average American to-day, if told the
Filipinos want independence, will give the statement about the same
consideration Mr. McKinley did then, and if told that the desire among
them for a government <i>of</i> their people <i>by their</i> people
<i>for</i> their people has not been diminished since the late war by
tariff taxation without representation, and the steady development of
race prejudice between the dominant alien race and the subject one, he
will begin to realize by personal experience how faintly the uttered
longings of a whole people may fall on distant ears.</p>
<p>We saw above that in a letter written July 21st, the day before the
telegram about the &ldquo;people expect independence,&rdquo; which
letter must have reached Washington within thirty days, General
Anderson not only notified Washington all about Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
government and its pretensions, but stated that at the request of
Admiral Dewey he had made no protest against it.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2297src" href="#xd27e2297" name="xd27e2297src">29</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>Yet straight on through the period of General
Merritt&rsquo;s sojourn in the Islands, which began July 25th, and
terminated August 29th, we find no protest ordered by Washington, and
we further find the purpose of the President as announced in the
instructions to Merritt, &ldquo;The powers of the military occupant are
<i>absolute and supreme</i>&rdquo; throughout the Islands, not only
<i>not</i> communicated to the Filipino people, but deliberately
suppressed from the proclamation published by General Merritt pursuant
to those instructions.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2310src" href=
"#xd27e2310" name="xd27e2310src">30</a></p>
<p>Comments and conclusions are usually impertinent and unwelcome save
as mere addenda to <i>facts</i>, but in the light of the facts
derivable from our own official records, is it any wonder that General
Anderson, a gallant veteran of the Civil War, and perhaps the most
conspicuous figure of the early fighting in the Philippines, delivered
an address some time after he came back home before the Oregon
Commandery of the Loyal Legion of the United States<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e2321src" href="#xd27e2321" name="xd27e2321src">31</a> on the
subject, &ldquo;Should republics have colonies?&rdquo; and answered the

writer is certainly one of these, and while calling in question the
wisdom and righteousness of our Philippine policy, he cannot refrain
from avowing just here a feeling of individual obligation to Mr. Root
for his exquisite tribute to the <i>personal</i> equation of Mr.
McKinley, delivered at the National Republican Convention of 1904,
which was, in part, as follows: &ldquo;How wise and skilful he was. How
modest and self-effacing. How deep his insight into the human heart.
<i>How swift the intuitions of his sympathy. How compelling the charm
of his gracious presence.</i> He was so unselfish, so genuine a lover
of his kind. And he was the kindest and tenderest friend who ever
grasped another&rsquo;s hand. Alas, that his virtues did plead in vain
against his cruel fate.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="first">Major-General Wesley Merritt&rsquo;s account of the
operations of the troops under his command in the First Expedition to
the Philippines may be found in volume i., part 2, <i>War Department
Report</i> for 1898. He left San Francisco accompanied by his staff,
June 29, 1898, arrived at Cavite, Manila Bay, July 25th, received the
surrender of the city of Manila August 13th, and sailed thence August
30th, in obedience to orders from Washington to proceed without
unnecessary delay to Paris, France, for conference with the Peace
Commissioners. According to General Merritt&rsquo;s report, about the
time he arrived Aguinaldo had some 12,000 men under arms, with plenty
of ammunition, and a number of field-pieces. The late lamented Frank D.
Millet has preserved for us, in his <i>Expedition to the
Philippines</i>, some valuable and intimate studies of this army of
Filipino besiegers whom our troops found busily at work when they
arrived in the Islands:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">It was an interesting sight at Camp Dewey to see the
insurgents strolling to and from the front. Pretty much all day long
they were coming and going, never in military formation, but singly,
and in small groups, perfectly clean <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>and tidy in dress, often
accompanied by their wives and children, and all chatting as merrily as
if they were going off on a pigeon shoot. The men who sold fish and
vegetables in camp in the morning would be seen every day or two
dressed in holiday garments, with rifle and cartridge boxes, strolling
off to take their turn at the Spaniards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reader will readily understand that there were many times as
many volunteers as guns. Mr. Millet continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">When they had been at the front twenty-four hours they
were relieved and returned home for a rest. They generally passed their
rifles and equipments on to another man and thus a limited number of
weapons served to arm a great many besiegers. They had no distinctive
uniform, the only badge of service being a red and blue cockade with a
white triangle bearing the Malay symbol of the sun and three stars, and
sometimes a red and blue band pinned diagonally across the lower part
of the left sleeve. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Many of them *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* had
belonged to the native volunteer force. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The recruits
were soon hammered into shape by the veterans of the rank and file.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Their men were perfectly obedient to orders
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and they made the most devoted soldiers. There was no
visible Commissary or Quartermaster&rsquo;s Departments, but the
insurgent force was always supplied with food and ammunition and there
was no lack of transportation. The food issued at the front was mostly
rice <i>brought up in carromatas to within a few hundred yards of the
trenches, when it was cooked by the women</i>. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Each man
had a double handful of rice, sometimes enriched by a small proportion
of meat and fish, which was served him in a square of plantain leaf.
Thus he was unencumbered with a plate or knife or fork and threw away
his primitive but excellent dish when he had &ldquo;licked the platter
clean.&rdquo; It was noticeable that the insurgents carried no water
bottles nor haversacks, and no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69"
href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>equipments indeed, but cartridge
boxes. They did not seem to be worried by thirst like our men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Although insignificant in appearance, they are fierce
fighters,&rdquo; wrote General Anderson to the Adjutant-General of the
army in July.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2365src" href="#xd27e2365"
name="xd27e2365src">1</a></p>
<p>General Merritt states in his report that Aguinaldo had
&ldquo;proclaimed an independent government, republican in form, with
himself as President, and at the time of my arrival in the Islands the
entire edifice of executive and legislative departments had been
accomplished, at least <i>on paper</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2375src" href="#xd27e2375" name="xd27e2375src">2</a> Of course at
that time we were still officially declining to take Filipino
aspirations for independence seriously, and preferred to treat
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s government as purely a matter of stationery. As a
matter of fact, an exhaustive examination of the official documents of
that period, made with a view of ascertaining just how much of that
Aguinaldo government of 1898 was stationery fiction and how much was
stable fact, has absolutely surprised one man who was out there from
1899 to 1905 (the writer), and I have no doubt will be interesting, as
mere matter of political necrology, to any American who was there
&ldquo;in the days of the empire&rdquo; as the
&ldquo;ninety-niners&rdquo; called it.</p>
<p>Early in the spring of 1899, Mr. McKinley sent out the Commission of
which President Schurman of Cornell University was Chairman, to try to
stop the war. They bent themselves to the task in a spirit as kindly as
that in which we know Mr. McKinley himself would have acted. They
failed because the war was already on and the Filipinos were bent on
fighting for independence to the bitter end. But they learned a good
deal about the facts of the earlier situation. Speaking of these in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>their report to the President<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e2384src" href="#xd27e2384" name="xd27e2384src">3</a> with
especial reference to the period beginning with Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
landing at Cavite in May, after describing how the Filipino successes
in battle with the Spaniards finally resulted in all of them being
driven into Manila, where they remained hemmed in, they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">While the Spanish troops now remained quietly in
Manila, the Filipino forces made themselves <i>masters of the entire
island except that city</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For three and one half months,&rdquo; says General Otis in
describing the facts of this same situation a year later, &ldquo;the
insurgents on land had kept Manila tightly bottled [meaning while
Admiral Dewey had been blockading the place by water] *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
and food supplies were exhausted.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2398src" href="#xd27e2398" name="xd27e2398src">4</a> &ldquo;We
had Manila and Cavite. The rest of the island was held <i>not</i> by
the Spanish but by the Filipinos,&rdquo; said General Anderson, in the
<i>North American Review</i> for February, 1900. &ldquo;It is a fact
that they were in possession, they had gotten pretty much the whole
thing except Manila,&rdquo; said Admiral Dewey to the Senate Committee
in 1902.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2409src" href="#xd27e2409" name=
"xd27e2409src">5</a></p>
<p>General Merritt took Manila August 13th, and sailed away for Paris
August 31st, and only a week after that General Otis wired Washington
(under date of September 7th) from Manila: &ldquo;Insurgents have
captured all Spanish garrisons in island [of Luzon] and control affairs
outside of Cavite and this city.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2416src" href="#xd27e2416" name="xd27e2416src">6</a></p>
<p>The recruiting by Aguinaldo of an army of 40,000 men with guns
within one hundred days after his little &ldquo;Return from
Elba&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;15,000 fighting men, 11,000 <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>of them
armed with guns,&rdquo; in fifty days,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2425src" href="#xd27e2425" name="xd27e2425src">7</a> which number
had swelled to nearly 40,000 men with guns in another fifty days (by
August 29th)<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2431src" href="#xd27e2431"
name="xd27e2431src">8</a>&mdash;is no more remarkable than his progress
in organizing his government and making its grip on the whole island of
Luzon effective in a short space of time.</p>
<p>As all Americans who know the Filipinos know how fond they are of
what government offices call &ldquo;paper work,&rdquo; and how their
<i lang="es">escribientes</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e2442src" href=
"#xd27e2442" name="xd27e2442src">9</a> can work like bees in drafting
documents, it might be easy to ignore Aguinaldo&rsquo;s various
proclamations, already hereinbefore noticed in Chapter II., as
representing merely &ldquo;a government on paper,&rdquo; were there no
other proof. But among the insurgent captured papers we found long
afterward, there is a document containing the minutes of a convention
of the <i lang="es">insurrecto</i> presidentes from all the pueblos of
fifteen different provinces, on August 6, 1898, which throws a flood of
light on the subject now under consideration.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2448src" href="#xd27e2448" name="xd27e2448src">10</a> This
convention was held at Bacoor, then Aguinaldo&rsquo;s headquarters, a
little town on the bay shore between Manila and Cavite. The minutes of
the convention recite that its members had been previously chosen as
presidentes of their respective pueblos in the manner prescribed by
previous decrees issued by Aguinaldo (already noticed), and that
thereafter they had taken the oath of office before Aguinaldo as
President of the government, etc. They then declare that the Filipino
people whom they speak for are &ldquo;not ambitious for power, nor
honors, nor riches, aside from the rational aspirations for a free and
independent life,&rdquo; and &ldquo;proclaim solemnly, in the face of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>the whole world, the Independence of the
Philippines.&rdquo; They also re-affirm allegiance to Aguinaldo as
President of the government and request him to seek recognition of it
at the hands of the Powers, &ldquo;because,&rdquo; says the paper,
&ldquo;to no one is it permitted to *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* stifle the
legitimate aspirations of a people&rdquo;&mdash;as if Europe cared a
rap what <i>we</i> did to them except in the way of regret that
<i>it</i> did not have a finger in the pie. However, they were not only
apprehensive, on the one hand, lest we might be tempted to take their
country away from Spain for ourselves, but also, on the other hand,
lest we might in the wind-up decide to leave them to Spain at the end
of the war. That this last was not an idle fear is shown by the fact
that during the deliberations of the Paris Peace Commission, Judge Gray
urged, in behalf of his contention against taking the islands at all,
that if Dewey had sunk the Spanish fleet off Cadiz, instead of in
Manila Bay, and the Carlists had incidentally helped us about that
time, we would have been under no resulting obligation &ldquo;to stay
by them at the conclusion of the war.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2463src" href="#xd27e2463" name="xd27e2463src">11</a> When the
presidentes in convention assembled as aforesaid got through with their
<span class="sc">whereases</span> and <span class=
"sc">resolutions</span> they presented them to His Excellency the
President of the Republic, Aguinaldo, who then issued a proclamation
which recited, among other things: &ldquo;In these provinces [the
fifteen represented in the convention] complete order and perfect
tranquillity reign, administered by the authorities
elected&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2474src" href="#xd27e2474"
name="xd27e2474src">12</a> according to his previous decrees as
Dictator, which decrees have already been placed before the reader. The
proclamation claims that the new government has 9,000 prisoners of war
and 30,000 combatants. The former claim no one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>having
any acquaintance with those times and conditions will question for a
moment. As to the 30,000 combatants, if he had 11,000 men armed with
guns on July 9th and 40,000 on August 29th, why not 30,000 on August
6th? Of course, men without guns, bolo men, do not count for much in a
serious connection like this now being considered. In November, 1899,
at San Jos&eacute;, in Nueva Ecija province, I heard General Lawton
tell Colonel Jack Hayes to disarm and turn loose 175 bolo men the
colonel had just captured and was lining up on the public square as we
rode into the town. But we are considering how much of a government the
Filipinos had in 1898, because the answer is pertinent to what sort of
a government they could run if permitted <i>now</i> or at any time in
the future; and, physical force being the ultimate basis of stability
in all government, when we come to estimate how much of an army they
had when their government was claiming recognition as a legitimate
living thing, we must remember that &ldquo;It was just a question of
arming them. They could have had the whole population.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2485src" href="#xd27e2485" name=
"xd27e2485src">13</a></p>
<p>Now the great significant fact about this Bacoor convention of
presidentes of August 6th&mdash;a week before Manila surrendered to our
forces&mdash;is that in it more than half the population of the island
of Luzon was represented. The total population of the Philippines is
about 7,600,000,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2493src" href="#xd27e2493"
name="xd27e2493src">14</a> and, of these, one-half, or
3,800,000<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2499src" href="#xd27e2499" name=
"xd27e2499src">15</a> live on Luzon. The other islands may be said to
dangle from Luzon like the tail of a kite. Taking the tables of the
American census of the Philippines of 1903 (vol. ii., p. 123), as a
basis on which to judge what Aguinaldo&rsquo;s claims of August 6th
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>amounted to if true, the population of the
provinces thus duly incorporated into the new government and in working
order on that date, was, in round numbers, about as follows: South of
Manila:&mdash;Cavite, 135,000; Batangas, 260,000; Laguna, 150,000;
Tayabas, 150,000; North of Manila:&mdash;Bulacan, 225,000; Pampamga,
225,000; Nueva Ecija, 135,000; Tarlac, 135,000; Pangasinan, 400,000;
Union, 140,000; Bataan, 45,000; Zambales, 105,000. This represents a
total of more than 2,000,000 of people.</p>
<p>But Aguinaldo&rsquo;s claims of August 6th are not the only evidence
as to the political status of the provinces of Luzon in August, 1898.
Toward the end of that month, Maj. J. F. Bell, Chief of General
Merritt&rsquo;s Bureau of Military Information, made a report on the
situation as it stood August 29th, the report being made after most
careful investigation, and intended as a summary of the then situation
according to the most reliable information obtainable, in order that
General Merritt might know, as far as practicable, what he would be
&ldquo;up against&rdquo; in the event of trouble with the
insurgents.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2509src" href="#xd27e2509" name=
"xd27e2509src">16</a></p>
<p>This report not only corroborates Aguinaldo&rsquo;s claims of August
6th, but it also concedes to the Aguinaldo people eight other important
provinces&mdash;four south of the Pasig River with a total population
of about 630,000,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2517src" href="#xd27e2517"
name="xd27e2517src">17</a> the only four of southern Luzon not included
in Aguinaldo&rsquo;s claim of August 6th, thus conceding him
practically all of Luzon south of the Pasig; and it furthermore
concedes him four great provinces of northern Luzon with a total
population of nearly 600,000.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2520src" href=
"#xd27e2520" name="xd27e2520src">18</a> General Bell states that these
last <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>are &ldquo;still in the possession of the
Spanish,&rdquo; but practically certain to be with the insurgents in
the very near future. &ldquo;Insurgents have been dispatched to attack
the Spanish in these provinces,&rdquo; says the Bell report.</p>
<p>In this same report Major Bell said: &ldquo;There is not a particle
of doubt but what Aguinaldo and his leaders will resist any attempt
<i>of any government</i> to reorganize a colonial government
here.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2530src" href="#xd27e2530"
name="xd27e2530src">19</a> When the insurgent government was finally
dislodged from its last capital and Aguinaldo became a fugitive hotly
pursued by our troops, he started for the mountains of northern Luzon,
passing through provinces he had never visited before. The diary of one
of his staff officers, Major Villa, in describing a brief stop they
made in a town <i>en route</i> (Aringay, in Union province) says:
&ldquo;After the honorable President had urged them [the townspeople]
to be patriotic, we continued the march.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2538src" href="#xd27e2538" name="xd27e2538src">20</a> They
certainly did &ldquo;continue the march.&rdquo; The Maccabebe scouts,
of which the writer commanded a company at the time, took the town a
few hours later, Aguinaldo&rsquo;s rear-guard retiring after a brief
resistance, following which we found, among the dead in the trenches, a
major other than Villa. Certainly, to read this little extract from the
diary of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s retreat is to feel the pulse of northern
Luzon as to its loyalty to the revolution at that time, and is
corroborative of these claims of Aguinaldo made in August, 1898,
supplemented, as we have seen them, by General Bell&rsquo;s
appraisal.</p>
<p>As to the political conditions which prevailed in southern Luzon,
particularly in the Camarines, in August and the fall of 1898,
information derived from one who was there then would seem appropriate
here. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>Major Blanton Winship, Judge Advocate&rsquo;s
Corps, U. S. A., Major Archibald W. Butt, the late lamented military
aide to President Taft, and the writer, lived together in Manila, in
1900, at the house of a Spanish physician, a Dr. Lopez, who had been a
&ldquo;prisoner&rdquo; at Nueva Caceres, a town situated in one of the
provinces of southern Luzon (Camarines) in the fall of 1898. Dr. Lopez
had a large family. They had also been &ldquo;prisoners&rdquo; down
there. No evil befell them at the hands of their &ldquo;captors.&rdquo;
They had the freedom of the town they were in. They had good reason to
be pretty well scared as to what the insurgents might do to them. But
they were never maltreated. The main impression we got from Dr. Lopez
and his family was that the political grip of the Aguinaldo government
on southern Luzon was complete during the time they were
&ldquo;prisoners&rdquo; there. If anybody doubts the absoluteness of
the grip of the Revolutionary government on the situation in the
provinces which were represented at the Bacoor convention of August 6,
1898, above mentioned, when the Filipino Declaration of Independence
was signed and proclaimed, let him ask any American who had a part in
putting down the Philippine insurrection what a presidente, an
<i>insurrecto</i> presidente, in a Filipino town, was in 1899 and 1900.
He was &ldquo;the whole thing.&rdquo; Even to-day the presidente of a
pueblo is as absolute boss of his town as Charles F. Murphy is of
Tammany Hall. And a <i>town</i> or <i>pueblo</i> in the Philippines is
more than an area covered by more or less contiguous buildings and
grounds. It is more like a township in Massachusetts. So that when you
account governmentally for the pueblos of a given province, you account
for every square foot of that province and for every man in it. For
several years before our war with Spain, nearly every Filipino of any
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>education and spirit in the archipelago belonged
to the secret revolutionary society known as the Katipunan. This had
its organization in every town when Dewey sank the Spanish fleet and
landed Aguinaldo at Cavite. The rest may be imagined.</p>
<p>By September, 1898, Aguinaldo was absolute master of the whole of
Luzon. Before the Treaty of Paris was signed (December 10, 1898), in
fact while Judge Gray of the Peace Commission was cabling President
McKinley that not to leave the government of the Philippines to the
people thereof &ldquo;would be to make a mockery of
instructions,&rdquo; Aguinaldo had become equally absolute master of
the situation throughout the rest of the archipelago outside of
Manila.</p>
<p>Toward the end of July, 1898, our Manila Consul, Mr. Williams, who
was one of our consular triumvirate of would-be Warwicks, or
&ldquo;original Aguinaldo men,&rdquo; of 1898, used to have nice talks
with Aguinaldo about the lion and the lamb lying down together without
the lion eating the lamb, and in one instance, at least, he goes so far
as to represent Aguinaldo as willing to some such
arrangement&mdash;<i>e. g.</i>, annexation, or some vague scheme of
dependence. But whenever we hear from Aguinaldo over his own signature,
we hear him saying whatever means in Tagalo &ldquo;Timeo Danaos et dona
ferentes.&rdquo; For instance, at page 15, of <i>Senate Document
208</i>, he writes Williams, under date of August 1st, with fine
courtesy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I congratulate you with all sincerity on the acuteness
and ingenuity which you have displayed in painting in an admirable
manner the benefits which, <i>especially for me and my leaders</i>, and
in general for all my compatriots, would be secured by the union of
these islands with the United States of America. Ah! that picture, so
happy and so finished *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* This is not saying that I am not
of your opinion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* You say all this and yet more will
result from annexing ourselves to your people *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* You are
my friend and the friend of the Filipinos and have said it. But why
should we say it? Will my people believe it? *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I have
done what they desire, establishing a government *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* not
only because it was my duty, but also because had I acted in any other
manner they would fail to recognize me as <i>the interpreter of their
aspirations</i>, and would punish me as a traitor, replacing me by
another <i>more careful of his own honor and dignity</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that we know what was in the Filipino mind when General Merritt
arrived in the Philippines, let us see what was in the American
military mind out there at the same time. Says General Merritt:
&ldquo;General Aguinaldo did not visit me on my arrival nor offer his
services as a subordinate leader.&rdquo; We trust the reason of this at
once suggests itself from what has preceded, including General
Anderson&rsquo;s dealings with the insurgent chief. The latter wanted
some understanding as to what <i>the intentions of our government
were</i>, and what was to be the programme afterward, should he and his
countrymen assist in the little fighting that now remained necessary to
complete the taking of Manila. <i>Those intentions were precisely what
Merritt was determined to conceal.</i> &ldquo;As my instructions from
the President fully contemplated the occupation of <i>the Islands</i>
by the American land forces, and stated that &lsquo;the powers of the
military occupant are absolute and supreme and immediately operate upon
the political condition of the inhabitants,&rsquo; I did not consider
it wise to hold any direct communication with the insurgent leader
until I should be in possession of the city of Manila.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2595src" href="#xd27e2595" name=
"xd27e2595src">21</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79"
name="pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p>On one occasion General Merritt passed through the village of Bacoor
where Aguinaldo had his headquarters, but, says Mr. Millet<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2604src" href="#xd27e2604" name=
"xd27e2604src">22</a> in mentioning this, &ldquo;They never met.&rdquo;
After the taking of the city, General Merritt remembered that with some
13,000 Spanish prisoners to guard, and a city of 300,000 people, all
but a sprinkling of whom were in sympathy with the insurgent cause, on
his hands, and an army of at least 14,000 insurgents&mdash;probably far
more than that&mdash;clamoring without the gates of that city, and only
10,000 men of his own with whom to handle such a situation, frankness
was out of the question, in view of his orders from the
President.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2609src" href="#xd27e2609" name=
"xd27e2609src">23</a> Therefore, on the day after the city surrendered,
General Merritt issued a proclamation, copying<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2615src" href="#xd27e2615" name="xd27e2615src">24</a>
<i>verbatim</i> from Mr. McKinley&rsquo;s instructions (<i>ante</i>)
such innocuous milk-and-water passages as the one which assured the
people that our government &ldquo;has not come to wage war upon them
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* but to protect them in their homes, in their
employments, and in their personal and religious rights; all persons
who, by active aid or honest submission, co-operate with the United
States *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* will receive the reward of its support and
protection.&rdquo; But he carefully omitted the words quoted above
about the powers of the military occupant being absolute and supreme,
&ldquo;lest his [Aguinaldo&rsquo;s] pretensions,&rdquo; to use General
Merritt&rsquo;s expression, &ldquo;should clash with my designs.&rdquo;
&ldquo;For these reasons,&rdquo; says General Merritt (p. 40),
&ldquo;the preparations for the attack on the city were *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
conducted without reference to the situation of the insurgent
forces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here General Merritt is speaking frankly but not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>accurately. He means he made his preparations
without any more reference to the situation of the insurgent forces
than he could help. As a matter of fact, their situation bothered him a
good deal. They were in the way. For instance, there was a whole
brigade of them at one point between our people and Manila.
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; says General Merritt (p. 41), &ldquo;was overcome
by instructions to General Greene to <i>arrange if possible</i> with
the insurgent brigade commander in his immediate vicinity to move to
the right and allow the American forces unobstructed control of the
roads in their immediate front. No objection was made,&rdquo; etc. That
reads very well&mdash;that about &ldquo;arrange if possible,&rdquo;
&ldquo;no objection was made,&rdquo; etc.,&mdash;does it not? Nothing
there through which &ldquo;the lustre and the moral strength&rdquo; of
the motives that prompted the Spanish war might be &ldquo;dimmed by
ulterior designs which might tempt us,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2633src" href="#xd27e2633" name="xd27e2633src">25</a> is there?
It was stated above that General Merritt was speaking frankly in this
report. He was. He probably did not know how General Greene carried out
the order to &ldquo;arrange if possible with the insurgent
brigadier-commander.&rdquo; But it so happened that there was a
newspaper correspondent along with General Greene who has since told
us. This gentleman was Mr. Frank D. Millet, from whom we have already
above quoted, the correspondent of the <i>London Times</i> and of
<i>Harper&rsquo;s Weekly</i>. General Greene had known him years before
in the campaigns of the Turco-Russian war. Mr. Millet had been a war
correspondent in those campaigns also, and General Greene was there
taking observations. So that in the operations against Manila, Mr.
Millet, being an old friend of General Greene&rsquo;s, known to be a
handy man to have around in a close place, was acting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>as a
civilian volunteer aide to the general.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2648src" href="#xd27e2648" name="xd27e2648src">26</a> Here is Mr.
Millet&rsquo;s account of what happened, taken from his book, <i>The
Expedition to the Philippines</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">On the afternoon of the 28th [of July, 1898], General
Greene received a verbal message from General Merritt suggesting that
he <i>juggle the insurgents out of part of their lines</i>, always on
his own responsibility, and without committing in any way the
commanding general to any recognition of the native leaders or opening
up the prospect of an alliance. This General Greene accomplished very
cleverly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Millet then goes on to tell how General Greene persuaded one of
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s generals (Noriel) to evacuate certain trenches so he
(Greene) could occupy them, &ldquo;with a condition attached that
General Greene must give a written receipt for the
entrenchments.&rdquo; This condition, Mr. Millet says, was imposed by
&ldquo;the astute leader&rdquo; (Aguinaldo). General Greene&rsquo;s
&ldquo;cleverness&rdquo; consisted in purposely failing and omitting to
give the receipt, which Mr. Millet says &ldquo;looked very much like a
bargain concluded over a signature, and was a little more formal than
General Greene thought advisable.&rdquo; The key to this sorry business
may be found in the first paragraph of General Merritt&rsquo;s
instructions to all his generals at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">No rupture with insurgents. This is imperative. <i>Can
ask</i> insurgent generals or Aguinaldo for <i>permission</i> to occupy
trenches, but if refused not to use force.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2676src" href="#xd27e2676" name="xd27e2676src">27</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite unable to explain,&rdquo; says Mr. Millet (p. 61),
&ldquo;why we did not in the very beginning make them understand that
we were masters of the situation, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82"
href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>and that they must come strictly
under our authority.&rdquo; The obvious reason was that a war of
conquest to subjugate a remote people struggling to be free from the
yoke of alien domination was sure to be more or less unpopular with
many of the sovereign voters of a republic, and more or less dangerous
therefore, like all unpopular wars, to the tenure of office of the
party in power. So that in entering upon a war for conquest, a republic
<i>must</i> &ldquo;play politics,&rdquo; using the military arm of the
government for the twofold purpose of crushing opposition and proving
that there is none.</p>
<p>The maxim which makes all fair in war often covers a multitude of
sins. But let us turn for a moment from strategy to principle, and see
what two other distinguished American war correspondents were thinking
and saying about the same time. Writing to <i>Harper&rsquo;s Weekly</i>
from Cavite, under date of July 16th, concerning the work of the
Filipinos during the eight weeks before that, Mr. O. K. Davis said:
&ldquo;The insurgents have driven them [the Spaniards] back over twenty
miles of country practically impassable for our men. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
Aguinaldo has saved our troops a lot of desperately hard campaigning
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. The insurgent works extend clear around Manila, and
the Spaniards are completely hemmed in. There is no hope for them but
surrender.&rdquo; Writing to the same paper under date of August 6th,
Mr. John F. Bass says: &ldquo;We forget that they drove the Spaniards
from Cavite to their present intrenched position, thus saving us a
long-continued fight through the jungle.&rdquo; This gentleman did not
tackle the question of inventing a new definition of liberty consistent
with alien domination. He simply says: &ldquo;Give them their liberty
and guarantee it to them.&rdquo; In the face of such plucky patriotism
as he had witnessed, political casuistry about <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>&ldquo;capacity for self-government&rdquo; would
have hung its head. Yet Mr. Bass was by no means a novice. He had
served with the British army in Egypt in 1895, through the Armenian
massacres of 1896, and in the Cretan rebellion and Greek War of 1897.
His sentiments were simply precisely what those of the average American
not under military orders would have been at the time. After the fall
of Manila he wrote (August 17th): &ldquo;I am inclined to think that
the insurgents intend to fight <i>us</i> if we stay and <i>Spain</i> if
we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were 8500 American troops in the taking of the city of Manila,
on August 13, 1898. The Filipinos were ignored by them, although they
afterwards claimed to have helped. As a matter of fact, the Spanish
officers in command were very anxious to surrender and get back to
Spain. The Filipinos had already made them &ldquo;long for
peace,&rdquo; to use a famous expression of General J. F. Bell. The
garrison only put up a very slight resistance, &ldquo;to save their
face,&rdquo; as the Chinese say, <i>i. e.</i>, to save themselves from
being court-martialed under some quixotic article of the Spanish army
regulations. The assault was begun about 9.30 <span class=
"sc">A.M.</span>, and early that afternoon the Spanish flag had been
lowered from the flag-staff in the main square and the Stars and
Stripes run up in its stead, amid the convulsive sobs of dark-eyed
se&ntilde;oritas and the muttered curses of melodramatic Spanish
cavaliers. Thanks to the Filipinos&rsquo; three and one half
months&rsquo; work, the performance only cost us five men killed out of
the 8500. The list of wounded totalled 43. Our antecedent loss in the
trenches prior to the day of the assault had been fourteen killed and
sixty wounded. So the job was completed, so far as the records show, at
a cost of less than a score of American lives.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2709src" href="#xd27e2709" name="xd27e2709src">28</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>As Aguinaldo&rsquo;s troops surged forward in the wake of the
American advance they were stopped by orders from the American
commander, and prevented from following the retreating Spaniards into
Manila. They were not even allowed what is known to the modern small
boy as &ldquo;a look-in.&rdquo; They were not permitted to come into
the city to <i>see</i> the surrender. President McKinley&rsquo;s
message to Congress of December, 1898, describes &ldquo;the last scene
of the war&rdquo; as having been &ldquo;enacted at Manila its starting
place.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2721src" href="#xd27e2721"
name="xd27e2721src">29</a> It says: &ldquo;On August 13th, after a
brief assault upon the works by the land forces, in which the squadron
assisted, the capital surrendered unconditionally.&rdquo; In this
connection, by way of explaining Aguinaldo&rsquo;s treatment at the
hands of our generals from the beginning, the message says,
&ldquo;Divided victory was not permissible.&rdquo; &ldquo;It was
fitting that whatever was to be done *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* should be
accomplished by the strong arm of the United States alone.&rdquo; But
what takes much of the virtue out of the &ldquo;strong arm&rdquo;
proposition is that Generals Merritt and Anderson were carrying out
President McKinley&rsquo;s orders all the time they were juggling
Aguinaldo out of his positions before Manila, and giving him evasive
answers, until the city could be taken by the said &ldquo;strong
arm&rdquo; <i>alone</i>. For, as the message puts it, in speaking of
the taking of the city, &ldquo;By this the conquest of the Philippine
Islands *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* was formally sealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When General Merritt left Manila on August 30th, he proceeded to
Paris to appear before the Peace Commission there. His views doubtless
had great weight with them on the momentous questions they had to
decide. But his views were wholly erroneous, and that they were so is
not surprising. As above stated, he did <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>not even meet Aguinaldo,
purposely holding himself aloof from him and his leaders. He never did
know how deeply they were incensed at being shut out of Manila when the
city surrendered. In his report prepared aboard the steamship
<i>China</i>, en route for Paris, he says: &ldquo;Doubtless much
dissatisfaction is felt by the rank and file of the insurgents, but
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I am of the opinion that the leaders will be <i>able to
prevent</i> serious disturbances,&rdquo; etc. (p. 40). If General
Merritt had caught the temper of the trenches he would have known
better, but he saw nothing of the fighting prior to the final scene,
nor did he take the field in person on the day of the combined assault
on the city, August 13th, and therefore missed the supreme opportunity
to understand how the Filipinos felt. Says General Anderson in his
report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I understood from the general commanding that he would
be personally present on the day of battle. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* On the
morning of the 13th, General Babcock came to my headquarters and
informed me that the major-general commanding would remain on a
despatch boat.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2742src" href="#xd27e2742"
name="xd27e2742src">30</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, so reduced was Manila, by reason of the long siege conducted
by the insurgents, that the assault of August 13th, not only was, but
was expected to be, little more than a sham battle. Says
Lieutenant-Colonel Pope, chief quartermaster, &ldquo;On the evening of
August 12th an order was sent me to report with two battalions of the
Second Oregon Volunteers, under Colonel Summers the next day on the
<i>Kwong Hoi</i> to the commanding general on the <i>Newport</i>, as an
escort on his entrance into Manila. At the hour named, I reported
etc.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2755src" href="#xd27e2755" name=
"xd27e2755src">31</a> As soon as Spanish &ldquo;honor&rdquo; was
satisfied, up <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>went the white flag and General Merritt was duly
escorted ashore and into the city, where he received the surrender of
the Spanish general.</p>
<p>In the Civil War, General Merritt had received six successive
promotions for gallantry, at Gettysburg, Yellow Tavern, Five Forks,
etc., and had been with Sheridan at Winchester. So the way he
&ldquo;commanded&rdquo; the assault on Manila is proof only of the
obligations we then owed the Filipinos. They had left very little to be
done.</p>
<p>In his account of General Merritt&rsquo;s original personal
disembarkation at Cavite, Mr. Frank Millet acquaints his readers with a
Philippine custom we afterwards grew quite familiar with and found
quite useful, of keeping your shoes dry in landing from a rowboat on a
beach by riding astride the shoulders of some husky native boatman. The
boatmen make it a point of special pride not to let their passengers
get their feet wet. Mr. Millet tells us that a general in uniform looks
neither dignified nor picturesque under such circumstances, and that
therefore he will not elaborate on the picture, but that it is
suggestive &ldquo;more of the hilarious than of the heroic.&rdquo;
Presumably when General Merritt went ashore on August 13th, from the
despatch boat from which he had been watching the assault on Manila, to
receive the surrender of the Spanish general, he followed the same
custom of the country he had used on the occasion of his original
disembarkation. So that in the taking of Manila, we were probably
literally, as well as ethically, like General Mahone of Virginia as he
is pictured in a familiar <i>post-bellum</i> negro story, according to
which the general met a negro on a steep part of the road to heaven,
told him that St. Peter would only admit mounted parties, mounted the
negro with the latter&rsquo;s consent, rode on his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>back the
rest of the toilsome journey to the heavenly gate, dismounted, knocked,
and was cordially welcomed by the saint at the sacred portal thus:
&ldquo;Why how d&rsquo; ye do, General Mahone; jess tie yoh hoss and
come in.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=

<p class="first">Major-general Elwell S. Otis and staff arrived at
Manila August 21, 1898.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2788src" href=
"#xd27e2788" name="xd27e2788src">1</a> He relieved General Merritt and
succeeded to the command of the American troops in the Philippines,
August 29th. Archbishop Chapelle, who was papal delegate to the
Philippines in 1900, once said to the writer at Manila, in that year,
that General Otis was &ldquo;of about the right mental calibre to
command a one-company post in Arizona.&rdquo; The impatience manifested
in the remark was due to differences between him and the
commanding-general about the Friar question. The remark itself was of
course intended, and understood, as hyperbole. But the selection of
General Otis to handle the Philippine situation <i>was</i> a serious
mistake. He was past sixty when he took command. He continued in
command from August 29, 1898, to May 5, 1900, a period of some twenty
months. The insurrection was held in abeyance for some five months
after he took hold, the leaders hoping against hope that the Treaty of
Paris would leave their country to them as it did Cuba to the Cubans;
and during all that time General Otis <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>was apparently unable to
see that war would be inevitable in the event the decision at Paris was
adverse to Filipino hopes. A member of General Otis&rsquo;s staff once
told me in speaking of the insurrection period that his chief
pooh-poohed the likelihood of an outbreak right along up to the very
day before the outbreak of February 4, 1899, occurred. <i>Before</i>
the insurrection came he <i>would</i> not see it, and <i>after</i> it
came he&mdash;literally&mdash;<i>did not</i> see it; that is to say,
during fifteen months of fighting he commanded the Eighth Army Corps
from a desk in Manila and never once took the field. His Civil War
record was all right, but he was now getting well along in years. He
was also a graduate of the Harvard Law School of the Class of 1861,
rather prided himself on being &ldquo;a pretty fair jack-leg
lawyer,&rdquo; and had a most absorbing passion for the details of
administrative work. They used to say that the only occasion on which
General Otis ever went out of Manila the whole time he was there was
when he went up the railroad once to Angeles to see that a proper
valuation was put on a then recently deceased Quartermaster&rsquo;s
Department mule. When he left the Islands he remarked to a newspaper
man that he had had but one &ldquo;day off&rdquo; since he had been
there. Unswerving devotion to a desk in time of war, on the part of the
commanding general of the army in the field, seemed to him an
appropriate subject for just pride. This showed his limitations. He was
a man wholly unable to see the essentials of an important situation, or
to take in the whole horizon. He was known to the Eighth Corps, his
command, as a sort of &ldquo;Fussy Grandpa,&rdquo; his personality and
general management of things always suggesting the picture of a
painfully near-sighted be-spectacled old gentleman busily nosing over
papers you had submitted, and finding fault to show he knew a thing or
two. However, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>he had many eminently respectable traits, and did
the best he knew how, though wholly devoid of that noble serenity of
vision which used to enable Mr. Lincoln, amid the darkest and most
tremendous of his problems, to say with a smile to Horace Greeley:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot the organist, he&rsquo;s doing the best he
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before General Otis relieved General Merritt, the latter had written
Aguinaldo politely requesting him to move his troops beyond certain
specified lines about the city,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2816src"
href="#xd27e2816" name="xd27e2816src">2</a> and Aguinaldo had replied
August 27th, agreeing to do so, but asking that the Americans promise
to restore to him the positions thus vacated in the event under the
treaty the United States should leave the Philippines to
Spain.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2822src" href="#xd27e2822" name=
"xd27e2822src">3</a> August 31st, Otis notified Aguinaldo, then still
at Bacoor, his first capital, that General Merritt had been
unexpectedly called away, and that he, Otis, being unacquainted with
the situation must take time before answering the Aguinaldo letter to
Merritt of the 27th. On September 8th, he did answer, in a
preposterously long communication of about 3000 words, which says,
among other things: &ldquo;I have not been instructed as to what policy
the United States intends to pursue in regard to its legitimate
holdings here&rdquo;; and therefore declines to promise anything about
restoring the insurgent positions in the event we should leave the
Islands to Spain under the treaty. Commenting on this in the <i>North
American Review</i> for February, 1900, General Anderson says: &ldquo;I
believe we came to the parting of the ways when we refused this
request.&rdquo; General Anderson was right. General Merritt had on
August 21st sent Aguinaldo a memorandum by the hand of Major J.
Franklin Bell which promised: &ldquo;Care will be taken to leave him
[Aguinaldo] <i>in as good condition <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91"
href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>as he was found by the forces of
the government.</i>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2835src" href=
"#xd27e2835" name="xd27e2835src">4</a> In the r&ocirc;le of political
henchman for President McKinley, which General Otis seems to have
conceived it his duty to play from the very beginning in the
Philippines, it thus appears that he was not troubled about keeping
unsullied the faith and honor of the government as pledged by his
predecessor. His 3000-word letter to Aguinaldo of September 8th ignores
Merritt&rsquo;s promise as coolly as if it had never been made. His
only concern appears to have been to leave the government free to throw
the Filipinos overboard if it should wish to. He peevishly implies
later on that Aguinaldo&rsquo;s requests in this regard were merely a
cloak for designs against us (p. 40). But his real reason is given in a
sort of stage &ldquo;aside&rdquo;&mdash;a letter to the
Adjutant-General of the army dated September 12, 1898, wherein he
explains: &ldquo;Should I promise them that in case of the return of
the city to Spain, upon United States evacuation, their forces would be
placed by us in positions which they now occupy, I thoroughly believe
that they would evacuate at once. But, of course, under the
international obligations resting upon us *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* no such
promise can be given.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2841src" href=
"#xd27e2841" name="xd27e2841src">5</a> In the sacred name of National
Honor what of the Merritt promise? You only have to turn a few pages in
the <i>War Department Report</i> for 1899 from the Merritt promise to
the Otis repudiation of it. Yes, General Anderson was right. It was
when General Otis practically repudiated in writing the written promise
of his predecessor, General Merritt, that we &ldquo;came to the parting
of the ways&rdquo; in our relations with the Filipinos. Let no American
suppose for a moment that the author of this volume is engaged in the
ungracious, and frequently deservedly thankless task of mere
muck-raking. He never met <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href=
"#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>General Otis but once, and then for a
very brief official interview of an agreeable nature. He is only
attempting to make a small contribution to the righting of a great
wrong unwittingly done by a great, free, and generous people to another
people then struggling to be free&mdash;a wrong which he doubts not
will one day be righted, whether he lives to see it so righted or not.
General Otis&rsquo;s letter to the Adjutant-General of the army of
September 12th, above quoted, shows that he was holding himself in
readiness to carry out in the Philippines any political programme the
Administration might determine upon, which would mean that he would
afterwards come home and tell how entirely righteous that programme had
been. Had the Administration hearkened back to Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s
suggestion that the Filipinos were far superior to the Cubans, and
decided to set before General Otis in the Philippines the same task it
had set before General Wood in Cuba, we would have heard nothing about
Filipino &ldquo;incapacity for self-government.&rdquo; General Otis
would have taken his cue from the President, his commander-in chief,
and said: &ldquo;I cordially concur in the opinion of Admiral
Dewey.&rdquo; Then he would have gone to work in a spirit of generous
rivalry to do in the Philippines just what Wood did in Cuba. And the
task would have been easier. Had the Administration taken the view
urged by Judge Gray, as a member of the Paris Peace Commission, that
&ldquo;if we had captured Cadiz and the Carlists had helped us [we]
would not owe duty to stay by them at the conclusion of the
war,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2851src" href="#xd27e2851" name=
"xd27e2851src">6</a> and therefore we were not bound to see the
Filipinos through their struggle, General Otis would have adopted that
view with equal loyalty and in the presidential campaign of 1900, he
would have furnished the Administration <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>with arguments to justify
that course. This would have been an easy task, also, for two of
Spain&rsquo;s fleets had been destroyed by us, leaving her but one to
guard her home coast cities, and making the sending of reinforcements
to the besieged and demoralized garrison of Manila impossible. The
native army she relied on throughout the archipelago had gone over
bodily to the patriot cause, and there was no hope of successful
resistance to it. But General Otis did not have the boundless prestige
of Admiral Dewey and so volunteered no advice. As soon as the
Administration chose its course, he set to work to prove the
correctness of it. From him, of course, came all the McKinley
Administration&rsquo;s original arguments against doing for the
Filipinos as we did in the case of Cuba. He was the only legitimate
source the American people could look to at that time to help them in
their dilemma. They were standing with reluctant feet where democracy
and its antithesis meet, and Otis was their sole guide. But the guide
was of the kind who wait until you point and ask &ldquo;Is that the
right direction?&rdquo; and then answer &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Four days
after General Otis sent his above quoted letter of September 12th, to
Adjutant-General Corbin, Mr. McKinley signed his instructions to the
Paris Peace Commissioners, directing them to insist on the cession of
Luzon at least, the instructions being full of eloquent but specious
argument about the necessity of establishing a guardianship over people
of whom we then knew nothing. From that day forward General Otis bent
himself to the task of showing the righteousness of that course.
&ldquo;I will let nothing go that will hurt the Administration,&rdquo;
was his favorite expression to the newspaper correspondents when they
used to complain about his press censorship. Hypocrisy is defined to be
&ldquo;a false assumption of piety or virtue.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>The
false assumption of piety or virtue which has handicapped the American
occupation of the Philippines from the beginning, and which will always
handicap it, until we throw off the mask and honestly set to work to
give the Filipinos a square deal on the question of whether they can or
cannot run a decent government of their own if permitted, is traceable
back to the Otis letter to the Adjutant-General of September 12, 1898,
ignoring General Merritt&rsquo;s promise to leave Aguinaldo &ldquo;in
as good condition as he was found by the forces of the
government&rdquo; in case we should, under the terms of the treaty of
peace, leave the Islands to Spain.</p>
<p>General Otis&rsquo;s letter of September 8th to Aguinaldo is
apparently intended to convince him that he ought to consider
everything the Americans had done up to date as exactly the correct
thing, according to the standards of up-to-date, philanthropic,
liberty-loving nations which pity double-dealing as medi&aelig;val; and
that he should cheer up, and feel grateful and happy, instead of
sulking, Achilles-like, in his tents; and furthermore&mdash;which was
the crux&mdash;that he must move said tents. General Otis does not
forget &ldquo;that the revolutionary forces under your command have
made many sacrifices in the interest of <i>civil liberty</i> (observe,
he does not call it independence) and for the welfare of your
people&rdquo;; admits that they have &ldquo;endured great hardships,
and have rendered aid&rdquo;; and avers, as a reason for
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s evacuating that part of the environs of Manila
occupied by his troops: &ldquo;It [the war with Spain] was undertaken
by the United States for humanity&rsquo;s sake *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* not for
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* aggrandizement or for any national profit.&rdquo; After
stating, as above indicated, that he does not yet know what the policy
of the United States is to be &ldquo;in regard to its legitimate
holdings here,&rdquo; General Otis proceeds to declare that in any
event he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>will not be a party to any joint occupation of any
part of the city, bay, and harbor of Manila&mdash;the territory covered
by the Peace Protocol of August 13th&mdash;and that Aguinaldo must
effect the evacuation demanded in the letter of General Merritt
&ldquo;before Tuesday the 15th&rdquo; (of September), <i>i.e.</i>,
within a week. Aguinaldo finally withdrew his troops, after much
useless parleying and much waste of ink.</p>
<p>There was some of the parleying and ink, however, that was not
wholly wasted. But to properly appreciate it as illustrative of the
fortitude and tact which the early Filipino leaders seem to have
combined in a remarkable degree, some prefatory data are essential.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo&rsquo;s capital was then at Bacoor, one of the small coast
villages you pass through in going by land from Manila to Cavite. From
Manila over to Cavite by water is about seven miles, and by land about
three or four times that. The coast line from Manila to Cavite makes a
loop, so that a straight line over the water from Manila to Cavite
subtends a curve, near the Cavite end of which lies Bacoor. Thus,
Bacoor, being at the mercy of the big guns at Cavite, and also easily
accessible by a land force from Manila, to say nothing of Dewey&rsquo;s
mighty armada riding at anchor in the offing, was a good place to move
away from. There it lay, right in the lion&rsquo;s jaws, should the
lion happen to get hungry. Aguinaldo had reflected on all this, and had
determined to get himself a capital away from &ldquo;the city, bay, and
harbor of Manila,&rdquo; that is to say, to take his head out of the
lion&rsquo;s jaws. General Otis&rsquo;s demand of September 8th that he
move his troops out of the suburbs of Manila determined him to move his
capital as well. He moved it to a place called Malolos, in Bulacan
province. Bulacan lies over on the north shore of Manila Bay, opposite
Cavite province <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>on the south shore. Malolos is situated some
distance inland, out of sight and range of a fleet&rsquo;s guns, and
about twenty-odd miles by railroad northwest of Manila. Malolos was
also desirable because it was in the heart of an insurgent province
having a population of nearly a quarter of a million people, a province
which, by reason of being on the north side of the bay, was sure to be
in touch, strategically and politically, with all Luzon north of the
Pasig River, just as Cavite province, the birthplace of Aguinaldo, and
also of the revolutionary government, had been with all Luzon south of
the Pasig. Should the worst come to the worst&mdash;and as has already
been indicated, the insurgents played a sweepstake game from the
beginning for independence, with only war as the limit&mdash;northern
Luzon had more inaccessible mountains from which to conduct such a
struggle for an indefinite period than southern Luzon. But while the
Otis demand of September 8th decided the matter of the change of
capital, Aguinaldo could not afford to tell his troops that he was
moving them from the environs of Manila because made to. He was going
to accept war cheerfully when it should become necessary to fight for
independence, but he still had some hopes of the Paris Peace Conference
deciding to do with the Philippines as with Cuba, and wished to await
patiently the outcome of that conference. Besides, he was getting in
shipments of guns all the time, as fast as the revenues of his
government would permit, and thus his ability to protract an ultimate
war for independence was constantly enlarging by accretion. The Hong
Kong conference of the Filipino revolutionary leaders held in the city
named on May 4, 1898, at which Aguinaldo presided, and which mapped out
a programme covering every possible contingency, has already been
mentioned. Its minutes say: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href=
"#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">If Washington proposes to carry out the fundamental
principles of its Constitution, it is most improbable that an attempt
will be made to colonize the Philippines or annex them.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2880src" href="#xd27e2880" name=
"xd27e2880src">7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the minutes of this same meeting as we saw
recognized that America might be tempted into entering upon a career of
colonization, once she should get a foothold in the islands. The
programme of Aguinaldo and his people was thus, from the beginning, not
to precipitate hostilities until it should become clear that, in the
matter of land-grabbing, the gleam of hope held out by the American
programme for Cuba was illusive. According to the minutes of the
meeting alluded to, such a contingency would, of course, &ldquo;drive
them, the Filipinos *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* to a struggle for their
independence, even if they should succumb to the weight of the
yoke,&rdquo; etc. Such a struggle, as all the world knows, did
ultimately ensue. That part of the parleying following Otis&rsquo;s
demand of September 8th (that Aguinaldo move his troops) which was
<i>not</i> useless was this: In order to &ldquo;save their face,&rdquo;
with the rank and file of their army, the Filipino Commissioners asked
General Otis &ldquo;if I [Otis,] would express in writing a simple
<i>request</i> to Aguinaldo to withdraw to the lines which I
designated&mdash;something which he could show to the
troops.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2893src" href="#xd27e2893"
name="xd27e2893src">8</a> So, on September 13th, General Otis wrote
such a &ldquo;request,&rdquo; and Aguinaldo moved his troops as
demanded, but no farther than demanded. He wanted to be in the best
position possible in case the United States should finally leave the
Philippines to Spain, and always so insisted. Long afterward General
Otis insinuated in his report that this <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e2899" title="Source: insistance">insistence</span>, which was
uniformly pressed until after the Treaty was signed, was mere dishonest
pretence, to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>cloak warlike intentions against the United
States. Yet, as we have seen above, one of our Peace Commissioners at
Paris, Judge Gray, just about the same time, was taking that
contingency quite as seriously as did Aguinaldo. And early in May,
1898, our Secretary of the Navy, Mr. Long, had cabled Admiral Dewey
&ldquo;not to have political alliances with the insurgents
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* that would incur liability to maintain their cause in
the future.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2905src" href=
"#xd27e2905" name="xd27e2905src">9</a> Before moving his troops
pursuant to the Otis demand of September 8th, the Otis
&ldquo;request&rdquo; was duly published to the insurgent army, and as
the insurgents withdrew, the American troops presented arms in most
friendly fashion. &ldquo;They certainly made a brave show,&rdquo; says
Mr. Millet (<i>Expedition to the Philippines</i>, p. 255), &ldquo;for
they were neatly uniformed, had excellent rifles, marched well, and
looked very soldierly and intelligent.&rdquo; &ldquo;The
withdrawal,&rdquo; says General Otis (p. 10), &ldquo;was effected
adroitly, as the insurgents marched out in excellent spirits, cheering
the American forces.&rdquo; Absolute master of all Luzon outside Manila
at this time, with complete machinery of government in each province
for all matters of justice, taxes, and police, an army of some 30,000
men at his beck, and his whole people a unit at his back, Aguinaldo
formally inaugurated his permanent government&mdash;permanent as
opposed to the previous provisional government&mdash;with a
Constitution, Congress, and Cabinet, patterned after our own,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2913src" href="#xd27e2913" name=
"xd27e2913src">10</a> just as the South American republics had done
before him when <i>they</i> were freed from Spain, at Malolos, the new
capital, on September 15, 1898. <i>The next day, September 16th, at
Washington, President <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99"
name="pb99">99</a>]</span>McKinley delivered to his Peace
Commissioners, then getting ready to start for the Paris Peace
Conference, their letter of instructions, directing them to insist on
the cession by Spain to the United States of the island of Luzon
&ldquo;at least.&rdquo;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e2926src" href=
"#xd27e2926" name="xd27e2926src">11</a> In other words, the day after
the little Filipino republic, gay with banners and glad with music,
started forth on its journey, Mr. McKinley signed its death-warrant.
The political student of 1912 may say just here, &ldquo;Oh, I read all
that in the papers at the time, or at least it was all ventilated in
the Presidential campaign of 1900.&rdquo; Mr. McKinley&rsquo;s
instructions to the Paris Peace Commission were not made public until
after the Presidential election of 1900. To be specific, they were
first printed and given out to the public in 1901, in <i>Senate
Document 148</i>, having been extracted from the jealous custody of the
Executive by a Senate resolution. It was not until then that the veil
was lifted. By that time, no American who was not transcendental enough
to have lost his love for the old maxim, &ldquo;Right or wrong, my
country,&rdquo; cared to hear the details of the story. The Filipinos
and &ldquo;our boys&rdquo; had been diligently engaged in killing each
other for a couple of years, and the American people said, &ldquo;A
truce to scolding; let us finish this war, now we are in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But to return from the death-warrant of the Philippine republic
signed by Mr. McKinley on September 16th, to its christening, or
inauguration, the day before. Mr. Millet gives an intensely interesting
account of the inaugural ceremonies of September 15th, which as Manila
correspondent of the <i>London Times</i> and <i>Harper&rsquo;s
Weekly</i> he had the good fortune to witness. Says he:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The date was at last *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* fixed for
September 15th. A few days before Aguinaldo had made a triumphant entry
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>into Malolos in a carriage drawn by white
horses, and there had been a general celebration of his arrival, with
speeches, a gala dinner, open air concerts, and a military parade. Mr.
Higgins (an Englishman), the manager of the Railway, kindly offered to
take me up to Malolos to witness the ceremony of the inauguration of
the new government. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The only other passenger was to be
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s secretary *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* a small boyish-looking
young man. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2949src" href=
"#xd27e2949" name="xd27e2949src">12</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems there had been a strike of the native employees of the
railway up the road.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Mr. Higgins calmly remarked to the secretary that, in
his opinion, if the affairs of the Filipino government were managed in
the future as they were at present, the proposed republic would be
nothing but a cheap farce. The secretary timidly asked what there was
to complain about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then came a tirade from Higgins, ending with, &ldquo;I am going to
lay this *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* before Aguinaldo to-day, and I shall expect
you to arrange an interview for my friend and myself.&rdquo; Then,
turning to the astonished Millet, he said in English: &ldquo;It does
these chaps good to be talked to straight from the shoulder. Since they
came to Malolos, the earth isn&rsquo;t big enough to hold
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This scene on the train is, decidedly, as Thomas Carlyle would say,
&ldquo;of real interest to universal history.&rdquo; Mr. Millet&rsquo;s
Government was a lion about to eat a lamb, but the head of his nation,
Mr. McKinley, clothed with absolute authority in the premises for the
nonce, was balking at the diet. Now, Mr. Millet rather admired the
British boldness, just as a Northern man likes to hear a Southerner
talk straight from the shoulder to a &ldquo;darkey.&rdquo; As soon as
the era of good feeling was over, our people quit treating the
Filipinos as Perry <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101"
name="pb101">101</a>]</span>did the Japanese in 1854, and began calling
them &ldquo;niggers.&rdquo; In fact the commanding general found it
necessary a little later to put a stop to this pernicious practice
among the soldiers by issuing a General Order prohibiting it. But Mr.
Millet&rsquo;s admiration would have been somewhat toned down had he
known what we found out later. The real secret of Higgins&rsquo;s
personal arrogance was this. The Filipino government needed his
railroad in its business. During the war which followed, the insurgents
long controlled a large part of this railway, from Manila to Dagupan,
which was the only railway in the Philippines. The railway properties
suffered much damage incident to the war, and&mdash;just how willingly
is beside the question&mdash;the company rendered material aid to the
insurgent cause. So much did they render, that when Higgins had the
assurance later to want our Government to pay the damages his
properties had suffered at the hands of the insurgents, our government
at Manila promptly turned his claim down. Subsequently the London
office of his company actually inveigled the British Foreign Office
into making representation to our State Department about the
matter&mdash;obviously a very grave step, in international law. The
claim was promptly turned down by Washington also, and, happily, that
&ldquo;closed the incident.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2967src"
href="#xd27e2967" name="xd27e2967src">13</a></p>
<p>Having exploded Mr. Millet&rsquo;s bubble, let us resume the thread
of his story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We reached the station [at Malolos] in about an hour
and a half. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The town numbers perhaps thirty or forty
thousand people. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* From the first humble <i>nipa</i>
shack to the great square where the convent stands, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>thousands of insurgent flags fluttered from
every window and every post. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Every man had an insurgent
tri-color cockade in his hat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then follows a detailed account of being introduced, after some
ceremony, to Aguinaldo, who is described as &ldquo;a small individual,
in full evening black suit, and flowing black tie.&rdquo; Higgins made
his complaint about the strikers, and Aguinaldo said, &ldquo;I will
attend to this matter of the strikers,&rdquo; and then changed the
topic, asking if the visitors did not wish to attend the opening of the
Congress&mdash;which they did.</p>
<p>From Mr. Millet&rsquo;s account, it is evident that, like Admiral
Dewey and most of the Americans who first dealt with the Filipinos
except Generals Anderson, MacArthur, and J. F. Bell, he failed to take
the Filipinos as seriously as the facts demanded. At that time the
Japanese had not yet taught the world that national aspirations are not
necessarily to be treated with contumely because a people are small of
stature and not white of skin. Consul Wildman at Hong Kong at first
wrote the State Department quite peevishly that Aguinaldo seemed much
more concerned about the kind of cane he should wear than about the
figure he might make in history. Wildman did not then know, apparently,
that canes, with all Spanish-Filipino colonial officialdom, were badges
of official rank, like shoulder-straps are with us. The reader will
also remember the toothbrush incident hereinbefore reproduced, told by
Admiral Dewey to the Senate Committee, in 1902. That incident,
naturally enough, amused the Committee not a little. But we who know
the Filipino know it was merely an awkward and embarrassed answer due
to diffidence, and made on the spur of the moment to cloak some real
reason which if disclosed would not seem so childish. <span class=

<p>Misunderstanding is the principal cause of hate in this world. When
you understand people, hatred disappears in a way strikingly analogous
to the disappearance of darkness on the arrival of light. The more you
know of the educated patriotic Filipino, the more certain you become
that the government we destroyed in 1898 would have worked quite as
well as most any of the republics now in operation between the Rio
Grande and Patagonia. The masses of the people down there, the peons,
are probably quite as ignorant and docile as the Filipino <i>tao</i>
(peasant), and I question if the educated men of Latin America, the
class of men who, after all, control in every country, could, after
meeting and knowing the corresponding class in the Philippines, get
their own consent to declare the latter their inferiors either in
intelligence, character, or patriotism.</p>
<p>But to return to the inauguration. Mr. Millet saw the inaugural
ceremonies in the church, and heard Aguinaldo&rsquo;s address to the
Congress. Of the audience he says &ldquo;few among them would have
escaped notice in a crowd for they were exceptionally alert, keen, and
intelligent in appearance.&rdquo; Of this same Congress and government,
Mr. John Barrett, who was American Minister to Siam about that time,
and is now (1912) head of the Bureau of American Republics at
Washington&mdash;an institution organized and run for the purpose of
persuading Latin-America that we do <i>not</i> belong to the Imperial
International Society for the Partition of the Earth and that we are
<i>not</i> in the business of gobbling up little countries on pretext
of &ldquo;policing&rdquo; them&mdash;said in an address before the
Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on January 12, 1899:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">He [Aguinaldo] has organized a government which has
practically been administering the affairs of that great <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>island [Luzon] since the American occupation of
Manila, which is certainly better than the former administration; he
has a properly constituted Cabinet and Congress, the members of which
compare favorably with Japanese statesmen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The present Philippine Assembly had not had its first meeting when I
left the Islands in the spring of 1905. It was organized in 1907. In
the summer of 1911, I had the pleasure of renewing an old and very
cordial acquaintance with Dr. Heiser, Director of Public Health of the
Philippine Islands, who is one of the most considerable men connected
with our government out there, and is also thoroughly in sympathy with
its indefinite continuance in its present form. The Doctor is a
<span class="corr" id="xd27e3010" title=
"Source: broad-guaged">broad-gauged</span> man likely to be worth to
any government, in matters of Public Health, whatever such government
could reasonably afford to pay in the way of salary, and is doubtless
well-paid by the Philippine Insular Government. He can hardly be
blamed, therefore, for being in sympathy with its indefinite
continuance in its present form. Doctor Heiser is a man of too much
genuine dignity to be very much addicted to slang, but when I asked him
about the Philippine Assembly, I think he said it was &ldquo;a
cracker-jack.&rdquo; At any rate, I have never heard any legislative
body spoken of in more genuinely complimentary terms than those in
which he described the Philippine Assembly. I learned from him
incidentally that their &ldquo;capacity for self-government&rdquo; is
so crude, however, as yet, that the members have not yet learned to
read newspapers while a colleague whose seat is next to theirs is
addressing the house and trying to get the attention of his fellows,
nor do they keep up such a buzz of conversation that the man who has
the floor cannot hear himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105"
href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>talk. They listen to the
programme of the public business.</p>
<p>Some five years ago in an article written for the <i>North American
Review</i> concerning the Philippine problem, the author of the present
volume said, among other things: &ldquo;During nearly four years of
service on the bench in the Philippines the writer heard as much
genuine, impassioned, and effective eloquence from Filipino lawyers,
saw exhibited in the trial of causes as much industrious preparation,
and zealous, loyal advocacy of the rights of clients, as any ordinary
<i>nisi prius</i> judge at home is likely to meet with in the same
length of time.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3023src" href=
"#xd27e3023" name="xd27e3023src">14</a> Any country that has plenty of
good lawyers and plenty of good soldiers, backed by plenty of good
farmers, is capable of self-government. As President Schurman of
Cornell University, who headed the first Philippine Commission, the one
that went out in 1899, said in closing his Founder&rsquo;s Day Address
at that institution on January 11, 1902: &ldquo;Any decent kind of
government of Filipinos by Filipinos is better than the best possible
government of Filipinos by Americans.&rdquo; The Malolos government
which Mr. Millet saw inaugurated on September 15, 1898, would probably
have filled this bill. Had the Filipino people then possessed the
consciousness of racial and political unity <i>as a</i> people which
was developed by their subsequent long struggle against us for
independence, and which has been steadily developing more and more
under the mild sway of a <i>quasi</i>-freedom whose princely
prodigality in spreading education is marred only by its declared
programme that no living beneficiary thereof may hope to see the
independence of his country, and that the present generation must
resign itself to tariff schedules &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; at Washington,
there is no reasonable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href=
"#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>doubt that the original Malolos
government of 1898 would have been a very &ldquo;decent kind of
government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All through the last four months of 1898, the two hostile armies
faced each other in a mood which it needed but a spark to ignite,
awaiting the outcome of the peace negotiations arranged for in
September, commenced in October, and concluded in December. While they
are thus engaged about Manila, let us turn to a happier picture, the
situation in the provinces under the Aguinaldo government. <span class=

<p class="first">In the last chapter, we saw Aguinaldo&rsquo;s republic
formally established at Malolos, September 15th, claiming jurisdiction
over all Luzon. In <a href="#ch4">Chapter IV</a>., entitled
&ldquo;Merritt and Aguinaldo,&rdquo; we saw the political condition of
southern Luzon in August, 1898, and the following months, and verified
the correctness of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s claims as to complete mastery
there then. Let us now examine the state of affairs in northern Luzon
in the fall of 1898.</p>
<p>In <i>Senate Document 196</i>, 56th Congress, 1st Session, dated
February 26, 1900, transmitted by Secretary of the Navy Long, in
response to a Senate resolution, may be found a report of a tour of
observation through the half of Luzon Island which lies north of Manila
and the Pasig River, made between October 8 and November 20,
1898,&mdash;note the dates, for the Paris Peace Conference began
October 1st and ended December 10th,&mdash;by Paymaster W. B. Wilcox
and Naval Cadet L. R. Sargent. This report was submitted by them to
Admiral Dewey under <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108"
name="pb108">108</a>]</span>date of November 23, 1898, and by him
forwarded to the Navy Department for its information, with the comment
that it &ldquo;in my opinion contains the most complete and reliable
information obtainable in regard to the present state of the northern
part of Luzon Island.&rdquo; The Admiral&rsquo;s endorsement was not
sent to the Senate along with the report. It appears in a book
afterwards published by Paymaster Wilcox in 1901, entitled <i>Through
Luzon on Highways and Byways</i>. The book is merely an elaboration of
the report, and reproduces most of the report, if not all of it,
<i>verbatim</i>. The book of Paymaster Wilcox may be treated as,
practically, official, for historical purposes. The preface recites
that in October, 1898, American control was effective only in Manila
and Cavite, that the insurgents, under Aguinaldo, who had proclaimed
himself President of the whole Archipelago, immediately after
Dewey&rsquo;s victory, were in supposedly complete possession of every
part of the Island outside of these two cities, that their lines were
so close to the outposts of our army that their people could at times
converse with our soldiers, and that General Otis&rsquo;s authority did
not extend much beyond a three-mile radius from the centre of Manila,
while Admiral Dewey held and operated the navy-yard at Cavite.
&ldquo;Even the country between Manila and Cavite was in the hands of
Aguinaldo, so much so that our officers had been refused permission to
land at any intermediate point by water, and were prohibited from
traversing the distance by road.&rdquo; Wilcox and Sargent procured
leave of absence from Admiral Dewey to make their trip. They went first
to Malolos, but failed to get anything in the way of safe-conduct from
Aguinaldo. He is described, however, as of &ldquo;great force of
character *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and he dominates all around him with a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>power that seems peculiar to himself.&rdquo;
Wilcox had seen him before at Cavite. &ldquo;He adroitly read between
the lines that the Government of the United States did not then, nor
would it at any future time, recognize his authority,&rdquo; says the
writer.</p>
<p>Our travellers left Manila, October 8, 1898, on the Manila-Dagupan
Railway, for a place called Bayambang, which is the capital of
Pangasinan province, about one hundred miles north of Manila. In
Pangasinan &ldquo;the people were all very respectful and polite and
offered the hospitality of their homes.&rdquo; From Bayambang they
struck off from the railroad and proceeded eastward comfortably and
unmolested a day&rsquo;s journey, to a town in the adjoining province
of Nueva Ecija (Rosales) where they received a cordial reception at the
hands of the Presidente (Mayor)&mdash;Aguinaldo&rsquo;s Presidente of
course, not the Presidente left over from the Spanish r&eacute;gime.
&ldquo;At this time all the local government of the different towns was
in the hands of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s adherents,&rdquo; says the
descriptive itinerary we are following. The tourists were provided at
Rosales by order of Aguinaldo with a military escort, &ldquo;which was
continued by relays all the way to Aparri&rdquo; (the northernmost town
of Luzon, at the mouth of the Cagayan River). Paymaster Wilcox says he
carried five hundred Mexican dollars in his saddle-bags, but used only
a trifling portion of this amount, &ldquo;for in every town my
entertainment was given without pay.&rdquo; They went from Rosales to
Humingan, in Nueva Ecija. At Humingan they were again entertained by
the Presidente at dinner, with music following, and comfortably housed.
The Presidente made many inquiries about &ldquo;the War with Spain and
their own future.&rdquo; Their future, as revealed by the raised
curtain of a year later, was that their country was being overrun by
Lawton&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>Division of the Eighth Army Corps, the author of
this volume having passed through this same town of Humingan in
November, 1899, as an officer of the scouts used to develop fire for
General Lawton&rsquo;s column. They journeyed eastward through the
province of Nueva Ecija from Humingan to a little village (Puncan) in
the foothills of the mountains they planned to cross. Of this place and
the hospitality there, our traveller remarks: &ldquo;I shall never
forget the welcome of the local official&rdquo; the Presidente. Thence
they proceeded a few more stages and parasangs, northward over the
Caranglan pass, into Nueva Vizcaya province, the watershed of north
central Luzon, and thence down the valley of the Cagayan River via
Iligan and Tuguegarao to Aparri, being always hospitably entertained in
every town through which they passed by the Presidente or Mayor of the
town, the local representative of the Philippine republic. In the
<i>New York Independent</i> of September 14, 1899, Cadet Sargent, in an
article about this trip, gives the words of the new Filipino national
Hymn, which he describes as sung with great enthusiasm everywhere he
and Wilcox were entertained in the various towns. I desire to preserve
a sample verse of it here. The music it is set to is much like the
<i>Marseillaise</i>&mdash;quite as stirring:</p>
<div lang="es" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Del sue&ntilde;o de tres siglos</p>
<p class="line">Hermanos Despertad!</p>
<p class="line">Gritando &ldquo;Fuera Espa&ntilde;a!</p>
<p class="line">Viva La Libertad!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">which, being interpreted, means:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">From the sleep of three centuries</p>
<p class="line">Brothers, awake!</p>
<p class="line">Crying &ldquo;Out with Spain!</p>
<p class="line">Live Liberty!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span></p>
<p>Had another Sargent and another Wilcox made a similar trip through
the provinces of southern Luzon about this same time, under similar
friendly auspices, before we turned friendship to hate and fear and
misery, in the name of Benevolent Assimilation, they would, we now
know, have found similar conditions.</p>
<p>Some suspicions were aroused on one or two occasions, but once the
local authorities became convinced that the trip was being made by
consent of &ldquo;The Illustrious Presidente&rdquo;
(Aguinaldo&mdash;&ldquo;El Egregio Presidente&rdquo; is the Spanish of
it) all was sunshine again. The Mayor of each town&mdash;the
Presidente&mdash;would receive from the escort coming with them from
the last town they had stopped at, a letter from the Mayor, or
Presidente, of said last town; the old escort would return to
<i>their</i> town, and a new one would be provided to give them
safe-conduct to the next town. This was no new-fangled scheme of
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s. It was an ancient custom of the Spanish Government,
and was an ideal nucleus of administration for the new government.
Curiously enough, the army knew practically nothing of this trip in the
days of the early fighting. All that country was to us a <i>terra
incognita</i>, until overrun by Captain Bacthelor, with a part of the
25th Infantry in the fall of 1899, the following year. So was the rest
of the archipelago a like <i>terra incognita</i>, until likewise slowly
conquered by hard fighting. That is why we so utterly failed to
understand what a wonderfully complete &ldquo;going concern&rdquo;
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s government had become throughout the Philippine
archipelago before the Treaty of Paris was signed. Descending from the
watershed of north central Luzon in the province of Nueva Viscaya
already mentioned, our travellers reached the town of Carig, in the
foothills which fringe that side of the watershed. There they
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>were met by Simeon Villa, military commander of
Isabela province, the man who was chief of staff to Aguinaldo
afterwards, and was captured by General Funston along with Aguinaldo in
the spring of 1901. Villa&rsquo;s immediate superior was Colonel
Tirona, at Aparri, the colonel commanding all the insurgent forces of
the Cagayan valley. Villa was accompanied by his aide, Lieutenant
Ventura Guzman. The latter is an old acquaintance of the author of the
present volume, who tried him afterwards, in 1901, for playing a minor
part in the murder of an officer of the Spanish army committed under
Villa&rsquo;s orders just prior to, or about the time of, the
Wilcox-Sargent visit. He was found guilty, and sentenced, but later
liberated under President Roosevelt&rsquo;s amnesty of 1902. He
<i>was</i> guilty, but the deceased, so the people in the Cagayan
valley used to say, in being tortured to death, got only the same sort
of medicine he had often administered thereabouts. At any rate, that
was the broad theory of the amnesty in wiping out all these old cases.
Villa was a Tagal and had come up from Manila with <span class="corr"
id="xd27e3129" title="Source: she">the</span> expedition commanded by
Colonel Tirona, which expedition was fitted out with guns furnished
Aguinaldo by Admiral Dewey, or, if not furnished, permitted to be
furnished. But Guzman was a member of one of the wealthiest and most
influential native families of that province (Isabela). General
Otis&rsquo;s reports are full of the most inexcusable blunders about
how &ldquo;the Tagals&rdquo; took possession of the various provinces
and <i>made</i> the people do this or that. Villa&rsquo;s relations
with Guzman were just about those of a New Yorker or a Bostonian sent
up to Vermont in the days of the American Revolution to help organize
the resistance there, in conjunction with one of the local leaders of
the patriot cause in the Green Mountain State. Both <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>were
members of the Katipunan, the Filipino Revolutionary Secret Society, an
organization patterned after Masonry, membership in which was always
treated by the Spaniards as sedition, and usually visited with capital
punishment. Nearly every Filipino of any spirit belonged to it on May
1, 1898, the date of the naval battle of Manila Bay. It is the
all-pervading completeness of this organization at that time&mdash;it
could give old Tammany Hall cards and spades&mdash;which explains the
astonishing rapidity of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s political success,
<i>i.e.</i>, the astonishing rapidity with which the Malolos Government
acquired control of Luzon between May and October, 1898. Their
cabalistic watchword was &ldquo;Paisano&rdquo; (fellow-countryman),
their battle cry &ldquo;Independence.&rdquo; In the fall of 1898, at
the time of this Wilcox-Sargent trip through Luzon, the Filipinos
really &ldquo;had tasted the sweets of Independence,&rdquo; to use the
phrase of the people of Iloilo in declining <i>on that ground</i> to
surrender to General Miller in December thereafter and electing the
arbitrament of war. The writer is perhaps as familiar with the history
of that Cagayan valley as almost any other American. It is true there
were cruelties practised by the Filipinos on the Spaniards. But they
were ebullitions of revenge for three centuries of tyranny. They do not
prove unfitness for self-government. I for one prefer to follow the
example set by the Roosevelt amnesty of 1902, and draw the veil over
all those matters. With the Spaniards it was a case of <i lang=
"fr">Sauve qui peut</i>. With the Filipinos, it was a case, as old man
Dimas Guzman, father to this Lieutenant Ventura we have just met, used
to put it, of <i lang="es">Me las vais a pagar</i>, which, liberally
interpreted, means, &ldquo;The bad quarter of an hour has arrived for
the Spaniards. The day of reckoning has come.&rdquo; I sentenced both
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>Dimas and Ventura to life imprisonment for being
accessory to the murder of the Spanish officer above named, Lieutenant
Piera. Villa officiated as archfiend of the gruesome occasion. I am
quite sure I would have hung Villa without any compunction at that
time, if I could have gotten hold of him. I tried to get hold of him,
but Governor Taft&rsquo;s Attorney-General, Mr. Wilfley, wrote me that
Villa was somewhere over on the mainland of Asia on British territory,
and extradition would involve application to the London Foreign Office.
The intimation was that we had trouble enough of our own without
borrowing any from feuds that had existed under our predecessors in
sovereignty. I have understood that Villa is now practising medicine in
Manila. More than one officer of the American army that I know,
afterwards did things to the Filipinos almost as cruel as Villa did to
that unhappy Spanish officer, Lieutenant Piera. On the whole, I think
President Roosevelt acted wisely and humanely in wiping the slate. We
had new problems to deal with, and were not bound to handicap ourselves
with the old ones left over from the Spanish r&eacute;gime.</p>
<p>It appears that Villa became a little suspicious of the travellers.
He detained them at Carig seven days. Finally there came a telegram
from his chief at Aparri, Colonel Tirona, to our two travellers, which
read: &ldquo;I salute you affectionately, and authorize Villa to
accompany you to Iligan.&rdquo; At Iligan, the capital of Isabela
province, the travellers were lavishly entertained. They were given a
grand <i>baile</i> (ball) and <i>fiesta</i> (feast), a kind of
dinner-dance, we would call it. To the light Messrs. Sargent and Wilcox
throw on the then universal acknowledgment of the authority of the
Aguinaldo government, and the perfect tranquillity <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>and
public order maintained under it, in the Cagayan valley, I may add that
as judge of that district in 1901&ndash;2 there came before me a number
of cases in the trial of which the fact would be brought out of this or
that difference among the local authorities having been referred to the
Malolos Government for settlement. <i>And they always waited until they
heard from it.</i> The doubting Thomas will attribute this to the
partiality of the Filipinos to procrastination in general. I know it
was due to the hearty co-operation of the people with, and their
loyalty to, the then existing government, and to their pride in it. Mr.
Sargent tells a characteristic story of Villa, whose vengeful feeling
toward the Spaniards showed on all occasions. The former Spanish
governor of the province was of course a prisoner in Villa&rsquo;s
custody. Villa had the ex-governor brought in, for the travellers to
see him, and remarked, in his presence to them, &ldquo;This is the man
who robbed this province of $25,000 during the last year of his
office.&rdquo; From Iligan our travellers proceeded to Aparri,
cordially received everywhere, and finding the country in fact, as
Aguinaldo always claimed in his proclamations of that period seeking
recognition of his government by the Powers, in a state of profound
peace and tranquillity&mdash;free from brigandage and the like. At
Aparri the visitors were cordially welcomed by Colonel Tirona, and much
f&ecirc;ted. While they were there, Tirona transferred his authority to
a civil r&eacute;gime. Says Paymaster Wilcox:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The steamer <i>Saturnus</i>, which had left the harbor
the day before our arrival, brought news from Hong Kong papers that the
Senators from the United States at the Congress at Paris favored the
independence of the islands with an American protectorate. Colonel
Tirona considered the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href=
"#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>information of sufficient
reliability to justify him in regarding Philippine Independence as
assured, and warfare in the Islands at an end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then goes on to describe the inauguration of civil government in
Cagayan province. I hope all this will not weary the American reader.
It was vividly interesting to me when I read it for the first time
thirteen years afterward, in 1911, because it was such unexpected
information, so surprising. It will be equally interesting to all other
Americans who participated in putting down the subsequent insurrection
and in setting up the Taft civil government in that same valley three
years later. I was in that town, for a similar purpose, with Governor
Taft in 1901, after a bloody war which almost certainly would not have
occurred had the Paris Peace Commission known the conditions then
existing, just like this, all over Luzon and the Visayan Islands. Of
course the Southern Islands were a little slower. But as Luzon goes, so
go the rest. The rest of the archipelago is but the tail to the Luzon
kite. Luzon contains 4,000,000 of the 8,000,000 people out there, and
Manila is to the Filipino people what Paris is to the French and to
France. Luzon is about the size of Ohio, and the other six islands that
really matter,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3176src" href="#xd27e3176"
name="xd27e3176src">1</a> are in size mere little Connecticuts and
Rhode Islands, and in population mere Arizonas or New Mexicos.
Describing the ceremonies of the inauguration of civil government in
Cagayan, the Wilcox-Sargent report to Admiral Dewey says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The Presidentes of all the towns in the province were
present at the ceremony. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Colonel Tirona made a short
speech. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* He then handed the staff of office to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>the man who had been elected &ldquo;Jefe
Provincial&rdquo; [Governor of the Province]. This officer also made a
speech in which he thanked the military forces *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and
assured them that the work they had begun would be perpetuated by the
people, where <i>every man, woman, and child stood ready to take up
arms to defend their newly won liberty and to resist with the last drop
of their blood the attempt of any nation whatever to bring them back to
their former state of dependence</i>. He then knelt, placed his hand on
an open Bible, and took the oath of office.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3187src" href="#xd27e3187" name="xd27e3187src">2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does not such language in an official report made by officers of the
navy to Admiral Dewey in November, 1898, show an undercurrent of deep
feeling at the position the Administration had put Admiral Dewey in
with Aguinaldo, when it decided to take the Philippines, and
accordingly sent out an army whose generals ignored his
prot&eacute;g&eacute;?</p>
<p>The speech of the provincial governor was followed, says the
Wilcox-Sargent report (same page) by speeches from &ldquo;the other
officers who constitute the provincial government, the heads of the
three departments&mdash;justice, police, and internal revenue. Every
town in this province has the same organization.&rdquo; Article III. of
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s decree of June 18th, previous, providing an organic
law or constitution for his provisional government (see Chapter II.,
<i>ante</i>) had provided precisely the organization which Wilcox and
Sargent thus saw working at Aparri and throughout the Cagayan valley in
October, 1898. The importance of all this to the question of how the
Filipinos feel toward us to-day, in this year of grace, 1912, and to
the element of righteousness there is in that feeling, is too obvious
to need comment. Americans interested in business in the Philippines
come back to this country from time <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>to time and give out
interviews in the papers declaring that the Filipinos do not want
independence. What they really mean is that it makes no difference
whether they want it or not, they are not going to get it. And it is
precisely these Americans, and their business associates in the United
States, who have gotten through Congress the legislation which enables
them to give the Filipino just half of what he got ten years ago for
his hemp, and other like legislation, and the Filipinos know it. The
gulf in the Philippines between the dominant and the subject race will
continue to widen as the years go by, so long as indirect taxation
without representation continues to be perpetrated at Washington for
the benefit of special interests having a powerful lobby. If the
American people themselves are groaning under this very sort of thing,
and apparently unable to help themselves, what is the <i>a priori</i>
probability as to our voteless and therefore defenceless little brown
brother. Like the sheep before the shearer, he is dumb. But to return
to our travellers and their journey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">A Norwegian steamer came into port [meaning the harbor
of Aparri] that afternoon, and this seemed our only hope. She was
chartered by two Chinamen *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. At first they refused us
permission to embark, and declined to put in at any port on the west
coast. No sooner was this related to Colonel Tirona than he sent notice
that the ship could not clear without taking us and making a landing
where we desired. This argument was convincing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Colonel Tirona provided them with a letter addressed to Colonel
Ti&ntilde;o at Vigan, the chief town of the west coast of Luzon and the
capital of the province of Ilocos Sur, which province fronts the China
Sea. Messrs. Wilcox and Sargent proceeded aboard the Norwegian
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>steamer from Aparri westward, doubling the
northwest corner of Luzon, and steaming thence due south to the nearest
port. Vigan was the Filipino military headquarters of the western half
of northern Luzon, just as Aparri was at the same time of the eastern
half. On the west coast the travellers were treated always courteously,
but with considerable suspicion. The explanation is easy. That region
is in closer touch with Manila, and with what is going on and may be
learned at the capital, than is the Cagayan valley which our tourists
had just left. They bade the commanding officer at Vigan good-bye,
November 13, 1898. Passing south through Namacpacan (which the command
I was with took a year or so later), they came to San Fernando de
Union, some twenty miles farther south along the coast road. Here they
met Colonel Ti&ntilde;o and presented their letter from Tirona. He gave
them a dinner, of course. How a Filipino does love to entertain, and
make you enjoy yourself! Talk about your &ldquo;true Southern
hospitality&rdquo;! You get it there. &ldquo;Speeches were made, and
great things promised by the Philippine republic in the near
future&rdquo; says Mr. Wilcox. After the dinner and speech-making came
the inevitable dance. After that Colonel Ti&ntilde;o started them off
on their journey southward toward Manila duly provided with carriages.
Passing Aringay on November 18, 1898<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3212src" href="#xd27e3212" name="xd27e3212src">3</a> our
travellers finally reached Dagupan, the northern terminus of the
Manila-Dagupan Railway, and there took a train for Manila, 120 miles
away.</p>
<p>In his report covering the fall of 1898, General Otis <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>always scoldingly says of the Filipinos that in
all the parleyings of his commissioners with Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
commissioners before the outbreak, the latter never did know what they
really wanted. The truth was they believed the Americans were going to
do with them exactly as every other white race they knew of had done
with every other brown race they knew of, but they did not tell General
Otis so. Mr. Wilcox, a more friendly witness of that same period states
their position thus at page twenty of the report to Admiral Dewey:
&ldquo;They desire the protection of the United States at sea, but fear
any interference on land.&rdquo; &ldquo;On one point they seemed
united, viz., that whatever our government may have done for them, it
had not gained the right to annex them,&rdquo; adding, in relation to
the physical preparations to make good this contention, in the event of
war, &ldquo;The Philippine Government has an organized force in every
province we visited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole tone of the Wilcox-Sargent report and the subsequent
Wilcox book is an implied reiteration, after intimate, extended, and
friendly contact with the people of all Luzon north of the Pasig River,
of Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s telegram sent to the Navy Department, June 23,
1898: &ldquo;The people are far superior in intelligence and capacity
for self-government to the people of Cuba and I am familiar with both
races.&rdquo; In fact Messrs. Wilcox and Sargent do not raise the
question of &ldquo;capacity for self-government&rdquo; at all, any more
than Commodore Perry did when similarly welcomed in 1854 by the
Japanese. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=

<p class="first">This is a tale of three cities, Paris, Washington, and
Manila.</p>
<p>Article III. of the Peace Protocol signed at Washington, August 12,
1898, provided:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The United States will occupy and hold the city, bay,
and harbor of Manila, pending the conclusion of a Treaty of Peace which
shall determine the control, disposition, and government of the
Philippines.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3249src" href="#xd27e3249"
name="xd27e3249src">1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;Papers relating to the Treaty with Spain&rdquo; including
the telegraphic correspondence between President McKinley and our Peace
Commissioners pending the negotiations, were sent to the Senate,
January 30, 1899, just one week before the final vote on the treaty,
but the injunction of secrecy was not removed until January 31,
1901&mdash;<i>after</i> the presidential election of 1900. They then
were published as <i>Senate Document 148</i>, 56th Congress, 2d
Session. It was not until then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122"
href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>that the veil was lifted. The
instructions to the Peace Commissioners were dated September 16, 1898.
The Commissioners were: William R. Day, of Ohio, Republican, just
previously Secretary of State, now (1912) Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States; Whitelaw Reid, Republican, then
editor of the <i>New York Tribune</i>, now Ambassador to Great Britain,
and three members of the United States Senate, Cushman K. Davis, of
Minnesota, William P. Frye, of Maine, Republicans, and George Gray, of
Delaware, Democrat. Senator Davis died in 1900, and Senator Frye in
1911. Senator Gray has been, since 1899, and is now, United States
Circuit Judge for the 3d Judicial District. Among other things, the
President&rsquo;s instructions to the Commissioners said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">It is my earnest wish that <i>the United States in
making peace should follow the same high rule of conduct which guided
it in facing war</i>. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* <i>The lustre and the moral
strength</i> attaching to a cause which can be confidently rested upon
the considerate judgment of the world <i>should not under any illusion
of the hour be dimmed by ulterior designs which might tempt us</i>
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* <i>into an adventurous departure on untried
paths</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By elaborate rhetorical gradations, the instructions finally get
down to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Incidental to our tenure in the Philippines is the
commercial opportunity. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The United States cannot accept
less than the cession in full right and sovereignty of the island of
Luzon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though already noticed, we venture, in this connection, again to
recall that in the month previous (August, 1898) a gentleman high in
the councils of the Administration<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3291src"
href="#xd27e3291" name="xd27e3291src">2</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>declared in one of the great reviews of the
period: &ldquo;We see with sudden clearness that some of the most
revered of our political maxims have outlived their force.&rdquo; Among
these &ldquo;revered maxims&rdquo; thus suddenly fossilized by his
<i lang="la">ipse dixit</i>, Mr. Vanderlip exuberantly includes the
teachings of &ldquo;Washington&rsquo;s Farewell Address and the later
crystallization of its main thought by President
Monroe&rdquo;&mdash;the Monroe Doctrine, adding that in lieu of these
&ldquo;A new mainspring *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* has become the directing force
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* the mainspring of commercialism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As permanent chairman of the Philadelphia convention which
renominated Mr. McKinley for the Presidency thereafter, in 1900,
Senator Lodge, speaking of the issues raised by the Treaty of Paris,
said: &ldquo;We make no hypocritical pretence of being interested in
the Philippines solely on account of others. We believe in Trade
Expansion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philanthropy and five per cent. go hand in hand,&rdquo; said
Mr. Vanderlip&rsquo;s Chief, Secretary of the Treasury Lyman J. Gage,
about the same time. Such was the temper of the times when the treaty
was made.</p>
<p>The first meeting with the Spanish Commissioners took place at
Paris, October 1st. The opening event of the meeting, the initial move
of the Spaniards, is extremely interesting in the light of subsequent
events, especially in connection with the Iloilo Fiasco, hereinafter
described (<a href="#ch9">Chapter IX</a>.).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spanish communication represents,&rdquo; says Judge
Day&rsquo;s cablegram to the President,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3314src" href="#xd27e3314" name="xd27e3314src">3</a> &ldquo;that
<i>status quo</i> has been altered and continues to be altered to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>prejudice of Spain by Tagalo rebels, whom it
describes as <i>an auxiliary force</i> to the regular American
troops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even diplomacy, in a conciliatory communication limited to the
obvious, called the Filipinos our allies.</p>
<p>The Spanish initial move was more immediately prompted by the fact
that in point of absolute astronomical time Manila, though captured
when it was morning of August 13th <i>there</i>, was captured when it
was evening of August 12th, at Washington, and the protocol was signed
at Washington in the evening of August 12th. While this point was
material, because we had captured $900,000 in cash in the Spanish
treasury at Manila and much other property, the title to which, under
the laws of war between civilized nations, depended on just <i>what
time</i> it was captured, the matter was finally swallowed up and lost
sight of in the agreement to give Spain a lump $20,000,000 for the
archipelago. But the initial move had other aspects. In the event we
should take the Philippines off her hands, Spain was going to insist
that we should get back from the Filipinos, our &ldquo;allies,&rdquo;
and restore to her all the Spaniards they captured after August 12th.
She knew that in all probability if we bought the Islands we would be
buying an insurrection, and she was &ldquo;taking care of her
own&rdquo; at our expense.</p>
<p>The next feature of the proceedings entitled to attention in a
bird&rsquo;s-eye view like this, concerns the question whether we
should take only Luzon, or the whole archipelago. President McKinley
cabled Admiral Dewey on August 13th, the day after the protocol was
signed, asking as to &ldquo;the desirability of the several
islands,&rdquo; &ldquo;coal <i>and other mineral deposits</i>,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;in a naval and commercial sense which (of the several
islands) would be most advantageous.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3342src" href="#xd27e3342" name="xd27e3342src">4</a> Admiral
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>Dewey had replied, of course, that Luzon was
&ldquo;the most desirable,&rdquo; but volunteered no advice. He
<i>did</i> state, &ldquo;No coal of good quality can be procured in the
Philippine Islands,&rdquo; which is still true. Allusion is made to
this telegram in the proceedings, but no copy of it is there set forth.
On October 4th, our Commissioners wired President McKinley suggesting
that he cable out to the Admiral and ask him &ldquo;whether it would be
better *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* to retain Luzon *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* or the whole
group.&rdquo; Mr. McKinley answered that he had asked Admiral Dewey
before General Merritt left Manila to give the latter his views in
writing &ldquo;on general question of Philippines,&rdquo; and that
&ldquo;his report is in your hands in response to both
questions.&rdquo; But the commission replied that Admiral Dewey had
sent only a copy of a report of General Francis V. Greene&rsquo;s and
nothing else. There is no record of any further advice or opinion from
Admiral Dewey on the point except that in General Otis&rsquo;s Report
(p. 67) we get glimpses of a telegram that has never yet, apparently,
been published, sent by Dewey to Washington early in December, 1898,
suggesting that we &ldquo;interfere as little as possible in the
internal affairs of the Islands.&rdquo; No; Admiral Dewey must be
acquitted of having ever counselled the McKinley Administration to buy
the Philippines.</p>
<p>On October 7th the Commission telegraphed Washington that General
Merritt attaches much weight to the opinion of the Belgian Consul at
Manila, M. Andr&eacute;, and that &ldquo;Consul says United States must
take all or nothing&rdquo;; that &ldquo;if southern islands remained
with Spain they would be in constant revolt, and United States would
have a second Cuba&rdquo;; that &ldquo;Spanish government would not
improve,&rdquo; and &ldquo;would still protect monks in their
extortion.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126"
name="pb126">126</a>]</span></p>
<p>To this advice there was absolutely no answer. It <i>was</i> a case
of &ldquo;all or nothing,&rdquo; and it had already become a case of
&ldquo;all&rdquo; when on September 16th previous Mr. McKinley signed
his original instructions to the Commission stating &ldquo;The United
States cannot accept less than Luzon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s telegram of October 7th goes on to quote from
the Belgian Consul&rsquo;s opinion that &ldquo;Present rebellion
represents only one half of one per cent. of the inhabitants.&rdquo;
The Consul was not before them in person. They were quoting from a
memorandum submitted by him to General Merritt at Merritt&rsquo;s
request, made at Manila and dated August 29th, the day General Merritt
sailed away from Manila bound for Paris via the Suez Canal. He had
brought the memorandum along with him. From the previous chapters the
reader will, of course, understand that Americans and Europeans at
Manila in August, 1898, were paying very little attention to Aguinaldo
and his claims as to the extent of his authority in the provinces. It
is therefore not surprising that M. Andr&eacute;&rsquo;s memorandum of
August 29th should have made the foolish statement, &ldquo;Present
rebellion represents only one half of one per cent. of
inhabitants.&rdquo; But it is eternally regrettable that his statement
on this point had any weight with the Commissioners, for it was, or by
that time at least (October 7th) had become, just about 99&frac12; per
cent. wide of the mark. As a matter of fact, by October 7th it would
have been more accurate to have said, in lieu of the above,
&ldquo;Present rebellion represents practically whole people.&rdquo;
You see, we started an insurrection in May, in October it had become a
full grown affair, and in December we bought it. The telegram of
October 7th also quoted General Merritt as saying, &ldquo;Insurgents
would be victorious unless Spaniards did <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>better in future than
in past,&rdquo; and as considering it &ldquo;feasible for United States
to take Luzon and perhaps some adjacent islands and hold them as
England does her colonies.&rdquo; These are about the only two sound
suggestions General Merritt made to that Commission. In the next breath
they quote him as saying, &ldquo;Natives could not resist 5000
troops.&rdquo; The fact that they did resist more than 120,000 troops,
that it took more than that, all told, to put down the insurrection, is
sufficient to show how much General Merritt&rsquo;s advice was worth.
He was right on two points, as indicated. Both Spanish fleets had been
destroyed and Spain had but one left to protect her home coast cities.
The death knell of her once proud colonial empire had sounded. Decrepit
as she was, she could not possibly have sent any reinforcements to the
Philippines. Besides the Filipinos would have &ldquo;eaten them
up.&rdquo; General Merritt&rsquo;s suggestion to &ldquo;hold them as
England does her colonies&rdquo; was also sensible. In fact that was
the only thoroughly honest thing to have done, if we were going to take
them at all. England never acts the hypocrite with her colonies. <i>She
makes them behave.</i> She does not let native people preach sedition
in native newspapers, because of &ldquo;sentimental bosh&rdquo; about
freedom of the press, until the whole country becomes a smouldering
hot-bed of sedition. She <i>has</i> blown offending natives from the
cannon&rsquo;s mouth, when deemed necessary to cure them and their
country of the desire for independence. If we are going to have
colonies at all, we ought to govern them with the upright downright
ruthless honesty of the British. <i>It is more merciful in the long
run.</i> But we ought not to have colonies at all. For if there is one
thing this republic stands for, above all other things, it is the
righteousness of aversion to a foreign yoke. <span class=

<p>In their telegram of October 7th,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3376src" href="#xd27e3376" name="xd27e3376src">5</a> the Peace
Commissioners, now squarely confronted with the question of forcible
annexation, begin to let the Administration down easy. They say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">General Anderson in correspondence with Aguinaldo in
June and July seemed to treat him and his forces as allies and native
authorities, <i>but subsequently changed his tone</i>. Merritt and
Dewey both kept clear of any <i>compromising</i> communications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A despatch sent by Judge Day certainly comes from high authority.
The word &ldquo;compromising&rdquo; is therefore important. To say that
Admiral Dewey did not treat Aguinaldo as an ally is to raise a mere
technical point. But Aguinaldo never did get anything from him in
writing. What he got consisted more of deeds than words. And actions
speak louder than words. We <i>had</i> an alliance with Aguinaldo, a
most &ldquo;compromising&rdquo; alliance and afterwards repudiated it.
Admiral Dewey made it and General Merritt repudiated it. Dewey did,
without the President&rsquo;s knowledge, exactly what the President and
the American people would have had him do at the time. And Merritt did
exactly what the President ordered him to do. But between the making of
the alliance, and the repudiation of it, the President and the American
people changed their minds. I say the American people, because they
afterwards ratified all that Mr. McKinley did. You see the bitterness
that lies away down in the secret recesses of the hearts of the
Filipino people to-day has its source at this point. They had &ldquo;a
gentleman&rsquo;s agreement,&rdquo; as it were, with us, not in
writing, made at a time when the thought of a colony had never entered
our minds. They fought in a common cause with us <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>on
the faith of that agreement&mdash;drove the Spaniards into Manila in
numerous victorious engagements involving much loss of life, on their
part, keeping the Dons thereafter bottled up in Manila on the land side
while their &ldquo;ally&rdquo; Admiral Dewey was doing the same on the
sea side. The said Dons were living on horses and rats, and famine was
imminent when our troops arrived and began to finish the work of taking
the beleaguered city. And then, having changed our minds and decided to
annex the islands, we repudiated our &ldquo;gentleman&rsquo;s
agreement,&rdquo; on the idea that the end justified the means. And the
end, as it has turned out, did not even justify the means, seeing that
the islands have proved a heavy financial liability instead of a
profitable asset. Judge Day&rsquo;s telegram to Secretary Hay of
October 12th (p. 27) contains this curious and surprising passage as to
Cuba:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Senator Gray in favor of accepting sovereignty
unconditionally *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* that we may thereby avoid future
complications with Cubans, claiming sovereignty while we are in process
of pacifying island *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* We desire instructions on this
point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The future of Cuba, however, trembled in the balance but for a
moment. Before &ldquo;the shell-burred cables&rdquo; had had time to
quit vibrating with the question thus propounded, there came back this
splendidly clean-cut answer from the President:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We must carry out the spirit and letter of the
resolution of Congress [declaring war].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In characterizing Judge Gray&rsquo;s position, above indicated, as
&ldquo;surprising,&rdquo; no reflection upon him is intended. On the
contrary, such a position, assumed by a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>man of such conceded
intellectual probity, is illuminating as to the attitude subsequently
taken concerning the Philippines by the Democratic Senators who voted
for the treaty. This attitude is stated by Senator Lodge, in his
<i>History of the War with Spain</i>, with all the incisive
forcefulness to which the country has so long been accustomed in the
public utterances of that distinguished man, and, seeing that no
promise had been made, as in the case of Cuba, Senator Lodge&rsquo;s
statement of the position of those who voted for the treaty should
forever set at rest the stale injustice, still occasionally repeated,
that Mr. Bryan, &ldquo;played politics&rdquo; in 1898&ndash;9 in urging
his friends in the Senate to vote for its ratification. Says Senator
Lodge (<i>History of the War with Spain</i>, p. 231):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The friends of ratification took the very simple
ground that the treaty committed the United States to no policy, but
left them free to do exactly as seemed best with all the islands; that
the American people could be safely entrusted with this grave
responsibility, and that patriotism and common sense alike demanded the
end of the war and the re-establishment of peace, which could only be
effected by the adoption of the treaty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>October 14th, Washington wires the commission that Admiral Dewey has
just cabled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">It is important that the disposition of the Philippine
Islands should be decided as soon as possible. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* General
anarchy prevails without the limits of the city and bay of Manila.
Natives appear unable to govern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this cablegram the Admiral most unfortunately repeated as true
some wild rumors then currently accepted by the Europeans and Americans
at Manila which of course were impossible of verification. I say
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>&ldquo;unfortunately&rdquo; with some
earnestness, because it does not appear on the face of his message that
they <i>were</i> mere rumors. And, that they were wholly erroneous, in
point of fact, has already been cleared up in previous chapters,
wherein the real state of peace, order and tranquillity which prevailed
throughout Luzon at that time has been, it is believed, put beyond all
doubt. But what manna in the wilderness to the McKinley Administration,
now that it was bent on taking the islands, was that Dewey message of
October 14th, &ldquo;The natives appear unable to govern&rdquo;!</p>
<p>On October 17th, Mr. Day wires Mr. Hay that the Peace Commissioners
feel the importance of preserving, so far as possible, the condition of
things existing at the time of signing the protocol, to prevent any
change in the <i>status quo</i>. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Might not our government *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* take more
active and positive measures than heretofore for preservation of order
and protection of life and property in Philippine Islands?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How could we, when Aguinaldo and his people were in the saddle all
over Luzon, had taken the <i>status quo</i> between their teeth and run
away with it, and were prepared to fight if bidden to halt and
dismount; and, which is more, were preserving order perfectly
themselves?</p>
<p>On October 19th, Mr. Hay repeated by wire to Mr. Day a cablegram
from General Otis which said: &ldquo;Do not anticipate trouble with
insurgents *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Affairs progressing favorably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Otis was making a desperate effort to humor Mr.
McKinley&rsquo;s &ldquo;consent-of-the-governed&rdquo; theory and
programme. But it was a situation, not a theory, which confronted him.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span></p>
<p>The date of the high-water mark of the Paris peace negotiations is
October 25th. On that day, Mr. Day wired Mr. Hay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Differences of opinion among commissioners concerning
Philippine Islands are set forth in statements transmitted (by cable
also) herewith. On these we request early consideration and explicit
instructions. Liable now to be confronted with this question in joint
commission almost immediately.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Messrs. Davis, Frye, and Reid, sent a joint signed statement. They
urged taking over the whole archipelago, saying that, as their
instructions provided for the retention at least of Luzon, &ldquo;we do
not consider the question of remaining in the Philippine Islands as at
all now properly before us.&rdquo; They also urged that as Spain
governed and defended the islands from Manila, we became, with the
destruction of her fleet and the surrender of her army, &ldquo;as
complete masters of the whole group as she had been, with nothing
needed to complete the conquest save to proceed with the <i>ample</i>
forces we had at hand to take <i>unopposed</i> possession.&rdquo; The
vice of this proposition, from the strategic as well as the ethical
point of view, is of course clear enough <i>now</i>.</p>
<p>Spain&rsquo;s government was already tottering in the Philippines
when the Spanish-American war broke out. To be &ldquo;as complete
masters as she had been&rdquo; was like becoming the recipient of a
quit-claim deed. Also, ours was not a case of taking &ldquo;unopposed
possession.&rdquo; An adverse claimant, relying on immemorial
prescription, was in full possession; all the tenants on the land had
attorned to him, and he and they were ready to defend their claim
against all comers with their lives. They reminded one of the recurrent
small farmer whom <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133"
name="pb133">133</a>]</span>some great timber or other corporation
seeks to oust, patrolling his land lines rifle in hand, on the lookout
for the corporation&rsquo;s agent and the sheriff with the
dispossessory warrant.</p>
<p>Messrs. Davis, Frye, and Reid go on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Military and naval witnesses agree that it would be
practically as easy to hold and defend the whole as a part.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hardly any one can fail to read with interest the following accurate
and vivid picture which they give of the physical strategic unity of
the Philippine Islands:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">There is hardly a single island in the group from
which you cannot shoot across to one or more of the
others&mdash;scarcely another archipelago in the world in which the
islands are crowded so closely together and so interdependent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This explains also why the Filipino people are <i>a people</i>.
Whenever the American people understand that, they will give them their
independence, unless they get an idea that government <i>of</i> their
people <i>by</i> their people <i>for</i> their people would be
distasteful to them.</p>
<p>In the memorandum of their views telegraphed to Washington on
October 25th, Messrs. Davis, Frye, and Reid also say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Public opinion in Europe, <i>including that of
Rome</i>, expects us to retain whole of Philippine Islands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Archbishop Chapelle was in Paris at the time of these negotiations.
He afterwards told the writer in Manila that he got that $20,000,000
put in the Treaty of Paris. The Church preferred that our title should
be a title by purchase rather than a title by conquest, and Mr.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>McKinley was vigorously urging the latter.
Between the legal effects of the two, there is a world of difference.
The Church outgeneralled the President&mdash;checkmated him with a
bishop. Look at that part of the treaty which affects church
property:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Article VIII. The *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* cession
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* cannot in any respect impair the property or rights
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* of *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* ecclesiastical *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
bodies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Church of Rome, or at least some of the ecclesiastical bodies
pertaining to it in the Philippines, owned the cream of the
agricultural estates. By the treaty they have not lost a dollar. It
might have been otherwise, had not Mr. McKinley&rsquo;s original claim
of title by conquest been overcome at Paris.</p>
<p>Judge Day&rsquo;s memorandum of his own views, telegraphed on
October 25th along with those of his colleagues, stated that he was
unable to agree that we should peremptorily demand the entire
Philippine group; that</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>In the spirit of our instructions</i>, and bearing
in mind the often declared disinterestedness of purpose and freedom
from designs of conquest with which the war was undertaken, <i>we
should be consistent</i> in demands in making peace *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
with due regard to our responsibility because of <i>the conduct of our
military and naval authorities in dealing with the insurgents</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We cannot leave the insurgents either to form a
government [he of course did not know what a complete government they
had already formed] or to battle against a foe which *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
might readily overcome them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also was of course unaware how thoroughly anxious the Spaniards
then in the Philippines were to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135"
href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>get away, and how completely
they were at the mercy of the new Philippine Republic and its forces.
&ldquo;On all hands&rdquo; says Judge Day, &ldquo;it is agreed that the
inhabitants of the islands are unfit for self-government.&rdquo; Of
course we knew absolutely nothing worth mentioning about the Filipinos
at that time. Judge Day then proposes, for the reasons indicated, to
accept Luzon and some adjacent islands, as being of &ldquo;strategic
advantage,&rdquo; and to leave Spain the rest, with a &ldquo;treaty
stipulation for non-alienation without the consent of the United
States.&rdquo; It seems to me that Judge Day&rsquo;s scheme was the
least desirable of all.</p>
<p>Senator Gray&rsquo;s memorandum of the same date is a red-hot
argument against taking over any part of the archipelago. He begins
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The undersigned cannot agree that it is wise to take
Philippine Islands in whole or in part. To do so would be to reverse
accepted continental policy of the country, declared and acted upon
through our history. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* It will make necessary
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* immense sums for fortifications and harbors
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Climate and social conditions demoralizing to character
of American youth *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. On whole, instead of indemnity,
injury *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. Cannot agree that any obligation incurred to
insurgents *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. If we had captured Cadiz and Carlists had
helped us, would not be our duty to stay by them at the conclusion of
war *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. No place for *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* government of subject
people in American system *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. Even conceding all benefits
claimed for annexation, we thereby abandon *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* the moral
grandeur and strength to be gained by keeping our word to nations of
the world *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* for doubtful material advantages and
<i>shameful stepping down from high moral position boastfully
assumed</i>. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Now that we have achieved all and more
than our object, <i>let us simply keep our word</i> *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.
<i>Above all let us not make a mockery of the</i> [President&rsquo;s]
<i>instructions</i>, where, after stating that we took <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>up
arms only in obedience to the dictates of humanity *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and
that we had no designs of aggrandizement and no ambition for conquest,
the President *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* eloquently says: &ldquo;It is my earnest
wish that the United States in making peace should follow the same high
rule of conduct which guided it in facing war.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next day, October 26th, came this laconic answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The cession must be of the whole archipelago or none.
The latter is wholly inadmissible and the former must be required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably the one thing about the Paris Peace negotiations that is
sure to interest the average American most at this late date is the
matter of how we came to pay that twenty millions. It was this way. On
October 27th, the Commission wired Washington:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Last night Spanish ambassador called upon Mr.
Reid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems they talked long and earnestly far into the night, trying
to find a way which would prevent the conference from resulting in
sudden disruption, and consequent resumption of the war. Mr. Reid made
plain the inflexible determination of the American people not to assume
the Cuban debt. The Ambassador said: &ldquo;Montero Rios<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3580src" href="#xd27e3580" name="xd27e3580src">6</a>
<i>could not return to Madrid</i> now if known to have accepted entire
Cuban indebtedness,&rdquo; and asked delay to see &ldquo;if some
concessions elsewhere might not be found which would save Spanish
Commissioners from utter repudiation at home.&rdquo; There is no doubt
that the talk we are now considering was a &ldquo;heart-to-heart&rdquo;
affair, probably quite informal. Yet it is one of the most important
talks that have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137"
name="pb137">137</a>]</span>occurred between any two men in this world
in the last fifty years. Mr. Reid finally threw out a hint to the
effect that as the preponderance of American public sentiment seemed
rather inclined to retain the Philippines, &ldquo;It was
possible,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but not probable that out of these
conditions the Spanish Commissioners might find something <i>either in
territory or debt</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e3590src" href=
"#xd27e3590" name="xd27e3590src">7</a> which might <i>seem to their
people at least like a concession</i>!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3597src" href="#xd27e3597" name="xd27e3597src">8</a></p>
<p>It was the leaven of this hint that leavened the whole loaf. There
was doubtless much informal parleying after that, but finally, the
American Commissioners, having become satisfied that Spanish honor
would not be offended by an offer having the substance, if not the
form, of charity, and being very tired of Spain&rsquo;s sparring for
wind in the hope of a European coalition against us should war be
resumed, submitted the following proposal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The Government of the United States is unable to
modify the proposal heretofore made for the cession of the entire
archipelago of the Philippine Islands, but the American Commissioners
are authorized to offer to Spain, in case the cession should be agreed
to, the sum of $20,000,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This alluring offer was accompanied with the stern announcement
that</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Upon the acceptance *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* of the proposals
herein made *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* <i>but not otherwise</i>, it will be
possible *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* to proceed to the consideration
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* of other matters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, our Commissioners wired Washington: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">If the Spanish Commissioners refuse our proposition
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* nothing remains except to close the negotiations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was very American and very final. Washington answered:
&ldquo;Your proposed action approved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>November 29th, Mr. Day wired Mr. Hay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Spanish Commissioners at to-day&rsquo;s conference
presented a definite and final acceptance of our last proposition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that is how that twenty millions found its way into the
treaty&mdash;not forgetting the prayers and other contemporaneous
activities of Archbishop Chapelle.</p>
<p>After the tremendous eight weeks&rsquo; tension had relaxed, and
before the final reduction to writing of all the details, we see this
dear little telegram, from Secretary of State Hay, himself a writer of
note, come bravely paddling into port, where it was cordially received
by both sides, taken in out of the wet, and put under the shelter of
the treaty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Mr. Hay to Mr. Day: In renewing conventional
arrangements do not lose sight of copyright agreement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is the last act of the drama:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Mr. Day to Mr. Hay, Paris, December 10, 1898: Treaty
signed at 8.50 this evening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="first">The ever-memorable Benevolent Assimilation
Proclamation, the Pandora box of Philippine woes, was signed December
21, 1898, and its contents were let loose in the Philippines on January
1, 1899.</p>
<p>Let us consider for a moment the total misapprehension of conditions
in the islands under which Mr. McKinley drafted and signed that famous
document&mdash;a misapprehension due to General Otis&rsquo;s curious
blindness to the great vital fact of the situation, viz., that the
Filipinos were bent on independence from the first, and preparing to
fight for it to the last. Take the following Otis utterance, for
example, concerning a date when practically everybody in the Eighth
Army Corps, and every newspaper correspondent in the Philippines,
recognized that war would be certain in the event the Paris Peace
negotiations should result, as common rumor then said they would
result, in our taking over the islands:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">My own confidence at this time in a satisfactory
solution of the difficulties which confronted us may be gathered
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>from a despatch sent to Washington on December
7th, wherein I stated that conditions were improving, and that there
were signs of revolutionary disintegration.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3666src" href="#xd27e3666" name="xd27e3666src">1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There can be no doubt that, at the date of that despatch, General
Otis had been given to understand that under the Treaty of Paris we
were going to keep the islands <i>if</i> the treaty should be ratified,
and also that the <i>if</i> might give the Administration trouble,
should trouble arise with the Filipinos before the <i>if</i> was
disposed of at home. As heretofore intimated, in addition to his
preference for legal and administrative work to the work of his
profession, in the Philippines General Otis constituted himself from
the beginning a political henchman. Ample evidence will be introduced
later on to show beyond all doubt that all through the early
difficulties, when the American people should have been frankly dealt
with and given the facts, General Otis would, in the exercise of his
military powers as press censor, always say to the war correspondents,
&ldquo;I will let nothing go that will hurt the
Administration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us see what the real facts of the Philippine situation were at
the date of the Treaty of Paris, December 10th, or, which is the same
thing, when General Otis sent his despatch of December 7th. When the
Treaty of Paris was signed, General Otis was in possession of Manila
and Cavite, with less than 20,000 men under his command, and Aguinaldo
was in possession of practically all the rest of the archipelago, with
between 35,000 and 40,000 men under his command, armed with guns, and
the whole Filipino population were in sympathy with the army of their
country. We have already seen the conditions in the various provinces
at that time and also the inauguration of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>native central government. Let us now examine
the military figures.</p>
<p>Ten thousand American soldiers were on hand when Manila was
captured, August 13th, and 5000 more had arrived under command of
Major-General Elwell S. Otis a week or so after the fall of the
city.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3689src" href="#xd27e3689" name=
"xd27e3689src">2</a> They had 13,000 Spanish soldiers to guard. In
addition to this, by the terms of the capitulation, the city
(population say 300,000), its inhabitants, its churches and educational
establishments, and its private property of all descriptions had been
placed &ldquo;under the special safeguard of the faith and honor of the
American army.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="n169.2src" href="#n169.2"
name="n169.2src">3</a> Some 4500 to 5000 more troops began to swarm out
of San Francisco bound for Manila in the latter part of October, 1898,
the last of them reaching Manila December 11th, the day after the
Treaty of Paris was signed. After that there were no further additions
to General Otis&rsquo;s command prior to the outbreak of war with the
Filipinos, February 4, 1899.<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n169.2">3</a> Of these (approximately) 20,000 men, only 1500 to 2000
were regulars, having the Krag-Jorgensen smokeless gun. The rest were
State volunteers, armed with the antiquated Springfield rifles, the
same the 71st New York and the 2d Massachusetts had been permitted to
carry into the Santiago campaign the summer before. Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
people were equipped entirely with Mausers captured from the Spaniards,
and other rifles, bought in Hong Kong mostly, using smokeless
ammunition. Major (now Major-General) J. F. Bell, who is, in the
judgment of many, one of the best all-round soldiers in the American
army to-day, was in charge of the &ldquo;Division of Military
Information&rdquo; at Manila both before and after the taking of the
city. General Bell <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142"
name="pb142">142</a>]</span>has done many fine things, in the way of
reckless bravery in battle at the critical moment and of bold
reconnoitring in campaign, and what he fails to find out about an
enemy, or a prospective enemy, is not apt to be ascertainable. In a
report bearing date August 29, 1898,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3704src" href="#xd27e3704" name="xd27e3704src">4</a> prepared in
anticipation of possible trouble with the Filipinos, he estimated the
number of men under arms that Aguinaldo had at between 35,000 and
40,000. This estimate is based by General Bell in his report on the
number of guns out in the hands of the Filipinos, which he figures
thus:</p>
<div class="table">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="cellLeft cellTop">Captured from Spanish militia</td>
<td class="xd27e3712 cellRight cellTop">12,500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="cellLeft">From Cavite arsenal</td>
<td class="xd27e3712 cellRight">2,500</td>

<tr>
<td class="cellLeft">From Jackson &amp; Evans (American merchants
trading with Hong Kong)</td>
<td class="xd27e3712 cellRight">2,000</td>

<td class="cellLeft">From Spanish (captured in battle)</td>
<td class="xd27e3712 cellRight">8,000</td>

<td class="xd27e3712 cellRight">15,000</td>

<tr>
<td class="cellLeft cellBottom">Total</td>
<td class="xd27e3712 cellRight cellBottom"><span class=
"sum">40,000</span></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>From this number General Bell deducts several thousands as having
been recaptured by the Spaniards, or bought in. I at once hear some
former comrade-in-arms of the Philippine insurrection say: &ldquo;Oh,
no. They couldn&rsquo;t have had as many as 40,000 guns, or near
that.&rdquo; I thought the same thing when I first read General
Bell&rsquo;s report on the matter. But he removes the doubt thus:
&ldquo;They are being continually sent away to other
provinces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We did not understand Aguinaldo&rsquo;s movements then. All his
troops were not around Manila. From what I learned from General Lawton
and his staff in 1899, my belief is that Aguinaldo had perhaps 30,000
men with guns around Manila, and out along the railroad, at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>the time of the outbreak of February 4th. It is
idle, of course, at this late date, to claim that the Filipinos were
not bent on independence from the first. The matured plans of their
leaders, formulated at Hong Kong May 4, 1898, before they ever started
the insurrection, preserved in the captured minutes of the meeting
already noticed,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3750src" href="#xd27e3750"
name="xd27e3750src">5</a> provide the programme to be adopted in the
event we should be tempted to keep the islands. In that event, they
were prepared against surprise, or any necessity for making new plans,
and were agreed to accept war as inevitable. From the first, they made
ready for it.</p>
<p>Governmentally and strategically, the Philippine Islands, except
Mohammedan Mindanao, which is a separate and distinct problem, may be
described very simply and sufficiently as consisting of the great
island of Luzon, on which Manila is situated, and the Visayan
group.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3758src" href="#xd27e3758" name=
"xd27e3758src">6</a> We are already familiar with the conditions in
Luzon in December, 1898. You hear a great deal about the Philippine
archipelago consisting of a thousand and one islands, but there are
only eight that are, broadly speaking, worth considering here. The
moment a jagged submarine ledge peeps out of the water it becomes an
island. And even before that it may wreck a ship. But we are talking
about islands that need to be charted on the sea of world politics. The
Visayan Islands that really count at all in a great problem such as
that we are now considering, are but six in number: Panay, capital
Iloilo; Cebu, capital Cebu; Bohol, Negros, Samar, and Leyte.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3761src" href="#xd27e3761" name="xd27e3761src">7</a>
Iloilo is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>some three hundred and odd miles south of
Manila, and, besides being the capital of Panay, is the chief port of
the Visayas and the second city of the archipelago, Cebu being the
third. Under the Spaniards, as now under us, a vessel might clear from
either of these places for any part of the world. As we saw in the
chapter preceding this, as early as November 18th, Admiral Dewey had
cabled Washington that the entire island of Panay was in possession of
insurgents, except Iloilo. By the end of December, all the Spanish
garrisons in the Visayan Islands had surrendered to the insurgents.
(<i>Otis&rsquo;s Report</i>, p. 61.) Iloilo did not surrender to the
insurgents until the day before Christmas. But let us not
anticipate.</p>
<p>December 13th, General Otis received a petition for protection
signed by the business men and firms of Iloilo (p. 54), sent of course
with the approval of the general commanding the imperilled Spanish
garrison. December 14th, he wired Washington for instructions as to
what action he should take on this petition, saying, among other
things, &ldquo;Spanish authorities are still holding out, but <i>will
receive</i> American troops&rdquo;; and adding one of his inevitable
notes of optimism as to the tameness of Filipino aspirations (at
Iloilo) for independence: &ldquo;Insurgents reported favorable to
American annexation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Otis knew the Spanish troops were hard pressed by the
insurgents down at Iloilo, and eagerly awaited a reply. President
McKinley was then away from Washington, on a southern trip, to Atlanta
and Macon, Georgia, and other points, and nobody at home was giving any
thought to the Filipinos, while they were knocking successively at the
gates of the various Visayan capitals, and receiving the surrender of
their Spanish defenders. It was getting toward the yuletide
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>season. President McKinley was engaged, quite
seasonably, in putting the finishing touches to the great work of his
life, which was welding the North and the South together forever by
wise and kindly manipulation of the countless opportunities to do so
presented by the latest war. It was a season of general peace and
rejoicing in a thrice-blessed land, and nobody in the United States was
looking for trouble with the Filipinos. With our people it was a case
of ignorance being bliss, so far as the Philippine Islands and their
inhabitants were concerned. In his <i>Autobiography of Seventy
Years</i>, Senator Hoar tells of an interview with President McKinley
concerning his (the Senator&rsquo;s) attitude toward the Treaty of
Paris, early in December, 1898.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3785src"
href="#xd27e3785" name="xd27e3785src">8</a> &ldquo;He greeted me with
the delightful and affectionate cordiality which I always found in him.
He took me by the hand, and said: &lsquo;How are you feeling this
winter, Mr. Senator?&rsquo; I was determined there should be no
misunderstanding. I replied at once: &lsquo;Pretty pugnacious, I
confess, Mr. President.&rsquo; The tears came into his eyes and he
said, grasping my hand again: &lsquo;I shall always love you whatever
you do.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It behooves this nation, and all nations, to consider those tears.
They explain all the subsequent history of the Philippines to date. Mr.
McKinley had proved himself a gallant soldier in his youth, and he knew
something of the horrors of war. He was also one of the most amiable
gentlemen that ever lived. But it is no disrespect to his memory to say
that while Mr. McKinley was a good man, Senator Hoar was his superior
in moral fibre, and he knew it, and he knew the country knew it. He
knew that Senator Hoar was going to fight the ratification of the
treaty to the last ditch, speaking for the Rights of Man and such old
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>&ldquo;worn out formul&aelig;,&rdquo; and that
his only defence before the bar of history would have to rest on
&ldquo;Trade Expansion,&rdquo; alias the &ldquo;Almighty Dollar.&rdquo;
Those tears were harbingers of the coming strife in the Philippines.
They were shed for such lives as that strife might cost. They were an
assumption of responsibility for such shedding of blood as the treaty
might entail. The President returned to Washington from his southern
trip on December 21st, and on December 23d (p. 55) cabled General Otis
the following reply to his request of December 14th for
instructions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Send necessary troops to Iloilo, to <i>preserve the
peace</i> and protect life and property. <i>It is most important that
there should be no conflict with the insurgents. Be conciliatory but
firm.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Senator Hoar had put Mr. McKinley on notice that he was going to
present the ethics of the case in the debate on the treaty. Congress
had gone home for the holidays, and after it re-assembled in January
the treaty would come up. The vote was sure to be close, and a too
vigorous manifestation of belief on the part of the Filipinos that this
nation was <i>not</i> closing the war with Spain animated by &ldquo;the
same high rule of conduct which guided it in facing war&rdquo; (Mr.
McKinley&rsquo;s instructions to the Peace Commissioners) might defeat
the ratification of the treaty. Indeed, the final vote of February 6th,
was so close that the Administration had but one vote to spare. The
final vote was fifty-seven to twenty-seven&mdash;just one over the
necessary two-thirds. The smoke of a battle to subjugate the Filipinos
might &ldquo;dim the lustre and the moral strength,&rdquo; as Mr.
McKinley had expressed it in his instructions to the Peace
Commissioners, of a war to free the Cubans. Therefore there must be no
trouble, at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>least until after the ratification of the
treaty. President McKinley had invented in the case of Cuba a very
catchy phrase, &ldquo;Forcible annexation would be criminal
aggression,&rdquo; and every time anybody now quoted it on him it
tended to take the wind out of his sails. So benevolently eager was
that truly kind-hearted and Christian gentleman to avoid the appearance
of &ldquo;criminal aggression&rdquo; that he evidently got to thinking
about that telegram of December 23d in which he had authorized General
Otis to send troops to the relief of the beleaguered Spanish garrison
at Iloilo, and also about the message from Admiral Dewey received
November 18th previous, to the effect that the entire island of Panay
except Iloilo was then already in the hands of the insurgents. The
result was that he decided not to let his conciliatory proclamation of
December 21st await the slow process of the mails, and therefore,
though it consisted of something like one thousand words, he had it
cabled out to General Otis in full on December 27th. It is now here
reproduced in full because it precipitated the war in the Philippines,
and is the key to all our subsequent dealings with them<a class=

<blockquote>
<p class="first">THE BENEVOLENT ASSIMILATION PROCLAMATION</p>
<p class="dateline"><span class="sc">Executive Mansion,
Washington</span>, December 21, 1898.</p>
<p>The destruction of the Spanish fleet in the harbor of Manila by the
United States naval squadron commanded by Rear-Admiral Dewey, followed
by the reduction of the city and the surrender of the Spanish forces,
practically effected the conquest of the Philippine Islands and the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>suspension of Spanish sovereignty therein. With
the signature of the treaty of peace between the United States and
Spain by their respective plenipotentiaries at Paris on the 10th
instant, and as a result of the victories of American arms, <i>the
future control, disposition, and government of the Philippine Islands
are ceded to the United States</i>. In the fulfilment of the <i>rights
of sovereignty</i> thus acquired and the responsible obligations of
government thus assumed, the actual occupation and administration of
the entire group of the Philippine Islands becomes immediately
necessary, and the <i>military government</i> heretofore maintained by
the United States in the city, harbor, and bay of Manila <i>is to be
extended</i> with all possible despatch <i>to the whole of the ceded
territory</i>. In performing this duty the military commander of the
United States is enjoined to make known to the inhabitants of the
Philippine Islands that in <i>succeeding to the sovereignty of
Spain</i>, in severing the former political relations, and in
establishing a new political power, the authority of the United States
is to be exerted for the securing of the persons and property of the
people of the islands and for the confirmation of all their private
rights and relations. It will be the duty of the commander of the
forces of occupation to announce and proclaim in the most public manner
that <i>we come</i> not as invaders or conquerors, but as friends,
<i>to protect</i> the natives in their homes, in their employments, and
in their personal and religious rights. All persons who, either by
active aid or by honest submission, co-operate with the Government of
the United States to give effect to these beneficent purposes will
receive the reward of its support and <i>protection</i>. All others
will be brought within the lawful rule we have assumed, with firmness
if need be, but without severity, so far as possible. Within the
absolute domain of <i>military authority</i>, which necessarily is and
<i>must remain supreme</i> in the ceded territory until the legislation
of the United States shall otherwise provide, the municipal laws of the
territory in respect to private rights and property and the repression
of crime are to be considered as continuing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>in
force, and to be administered by the ordinary tribunals, so far as
practicable. The operations of civil and municipal government are to be
performed by such officers as may accept <i>the supremacy of the United
States</i> by taking the oath of allegiance, or by officers chosen, as
far as practicable, from the inhabitants of the islands. While the
control of all the public property and the revenues of the state passes
with the cession, and while the use and management of all public means
of transportation are necessarily reserved to the authority of the
United States, private property, whether belonging to individuals or
corporations, is to be respected except for cause duly established. The
taxes and duties heretofore payable by the inhabitants to the late
government become payable to the authorities of the United States
unless it be seen fit to substitute for them other reasonable rates or
modes of contribution to the expenses of government, whether general or
local. If private property be taken for military use, it shall be paid
for when possible in cash, at a fair valuation, and when payment in
cash is not practicable, receipts are to be given. All ports and places
in the Philippine Islands in the actual possession of the land and
naval forces of the United States will be opened to the commerce of all
friendly nations. All goods and wares not prohibited for military
reasons by due announcement of the military authority will be admitted
upon payment of such duties and other charges as shall be in force at
the time of their importation. Finally, it should be the earnest wish
and paramount aim of the military administration to win the confidence,
respect, and affection of the inhabitants of the Philippines by
assuring them in every possible way that full measure of individual
rights and liberties which is the heritage of free peoples, and by
proving to them that the mission of the United States is one of</p>
<p>BENEVOLENT ASSIMILATION</p>
<p>substituting the mild sway of justice and right for arbitrary rule.
In the fulfilment of this high mission, supporting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>the
temperate administration of affairs for the greatest good of the
governed, there must be sedulously maintained the strong arm of
authority, to repress disturbance and to overcome all obstacles to the
bestowal of the blessings of good and stable government upon the people
of the Philippine Islands under the free flag of the United States.</p>
<p class="signed"><span class="sc">William McKinley.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The words used in the foregoing proclamation which were regarded by
the Filipinos as &ldquo;fighting words,&rdquo; <i>i. e.</i>, as making
certain the long anticipated probability of a war for independence, are
those which appear in italics. The rest of the proclamation counted for
nothing with them. They had been used to the hollow rhetoric and
flowery promises of equally eloquent Spanish proclamations all their
lives, they and their fathers before them.</p>
<p>In suing to President McKinley for peace on July 22d, previous, the
Prime Minister of Spain had justified all the atrocities committed and
permitted by his government in Cuba during the thirty years&rsquo;
struggle for independence there which preceded the Spanish-American War
by saying that what Spain had done had been prompted only by a
&ldquo;desire to spare the great island from the dangers of premature
independence.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3888src" href=
"#xd27e3888" name="xd27e3888src">10</a></p>
<p>Clearly, from the Filipino point of view, the United States was now
determined &ldquo;to spare them from the dangers of premature
independence,&rdquo; using such force as might be necessary for the
accomplishment of that pious purpose.</p>
<p>The truth is that, Prometheus-like, we stole the sacred fire from
the altar of Freedom whereupon the flames of the Spanish War were
kindled, and gave it to the Filipinos, justifying the means by the end;
and &ldquo;the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>links of the lame Lemnian&rdquo; have been
festering in our flesh ever since. The Benevolent Assimilation
Proclamation was a kind of Pandora Box, supposed to contain all the
blessings of Liberty, but when the lid was taken off, woes innumerable
befell the intended beneficiaries, and left them only the Hope of
Freedom&mdash;from us. Verily there is nothing new under the sun. It is
written: &ldquo;Thou shalt not steal&rdquo; anything&mdash;not even
&ldquo;sacred fire.&rdquo; There is no such thing as nimble morality.
The lesson of the old Greek poet fits our case. So also, indeed, do
those of the modern sage, Maeterlinck, for the Filipinos could have
found their own Bluebird for happiness. The record of our experience in
the Philippines is full of reminders, which will multiply as the years
go by, that, after all, every people have an &ldquo;unalienable
right&rdquo; to pursue happiness <i>in their own way</i> as opposed to
<i>somebody else&rsquo;s way</i>. That is the law of God, as God gives
me to see the right. Conceived during the Christmas holiday season and
in the spirit of that blessed season and presented to the Filipino
people on New Year&rsquo;s Day, received by them practically as a
declaration of war and baptized in the blood of thousands of them in
the battle of February 4th thereafter, the manner of the reception of
this famous document, the initial reversal and subsequent evolution of
its policies, and all the lights and shadows of Benevolent Assimilation
will be traced in the chapters which follow. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have already seen how busily Aguinaldo occupied
himself during the protracted peace negotiations at Paris in getting
his government and people ready for the struggle for independence which
he early and shrewdly guessed would be ultimately forthcoming. General
Otis was in no position to preserve the <i>status quo</i>. The
<i>status quo</i> was a worm in hot ashes that would not stay still.
The revolution was a snow-ball that <i>would</i> roll. The day after
Christmas, General Otis at last sent an expedition under General Marcus
P. Miller to the relief of Iloilo, but when it arrived, December 28th,
the Spaniards had already turned the town over to the insurgent
authorities, and sailed away. When General Miller arrived, being under
imperative orders from Washington to be conciliatory, and under no
circumstances to have a clash with the insurgents, the
Administration&rsquo;s most earnest solicitude being to avoid a clash,
at least until the treaty of peace with Spain should be ratified by the
United States Senate, he courteously <i>asked permission</i> to land,
several times, being refused each time. With a request of this sort
sent ashore January 1, 1899, he transmitted <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>a
copy of the proclamation set forth in the preceding chapter. The
insurgent reply defiantly forbade him to land. Therefore he did not
land&mdash;because Washington was pulling the strings&mdash;until after
the treaty was ratified. &ldquo;So here we are at Iloilo, an exploded
bluff,&rdquo; wrote war correspondent J. F. Bass to his paper,
<i>Harper&rsquo;s Weekly</i>.</p>
<p>By the time the treaty was ratified the battle of Manila of February
4th had occurred, and the pusillanimity of self-doubting diplomacy had
given way to the red honesty of war.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3942src" href="#xd27e3942" name="xd27e3942src">1</a></p>
<p>As was noticed in the chapter preceding this, by the end of
December, 1898, all military stations outside Luzon, with the exception
of Zamboanga, in the extreme south of the great Mohammedan island of
Mindanao near Borneo, had been turned over by the Spaniards to the
insurgents. When General Miller, commanding the expedition to Iloilo,
arrived in the harbor of that city with his teeming troop-ships and
naval escorts on December 28th, an aide of the Filipino commanding
general came aboard the boat he was on and &ldquo;desired to
know,&rdquo; says General Miller&rsquo;s report,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3947src" href="#xd27e3947" name="xd27e3947src">2</a> &ldquo;if we
had anything against them&mdash;were we going to interfere with
them.&rdquo; General Miller then sent some of his own aides ashore with
a letter to the insurgent authorities, explaining the peaceful nature
of his errand. They at once asked if our people had brought down any
instructions from Aguinaldo. Answering in the negative, General
Miller&rsquo;s aides handed them his olive-branch letter. They read it
and said they could do nothing without orders from Aguinaldo &ldquo;in
cases <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>affecting their Federal Government.&rdquo; The
grim veteran commanding the American troops smoked on this for a day or
so, and then asked a delegation of insurgents that were visiting his
ship by his invitation&mdash;they would not let him land, you
see&mdash;whether if he landed they would meet him with armed
resistance. The Malay reverence for the relation of host and guest
resulted in an evasive reply. They could not answer. But after they
went back to the city they did answer. And this is what they wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Upon the return of your commissioners last night, we
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* discussed the situation and attitude of this region of
Bisayas in regard to its relations and dependence upon the central
government of Luzon (the Aguinaldo government, of course); and
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I have the honor to notify you that, in conjunction
with the people, the army, and the committee, we insist upon our
pretension <i>not to consent *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* to any foreign
interference without express orders from the central government of
Luzon *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* with which we are one in ideas, as we have been
until now in sacrifices</i>. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* If you insist
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* upon disembarking your forces, this is our final
attitude. <i>May God forgive you, etc.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="dateline">Iloilo, December 30, 1898.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3965src" href="#xd27e3965" name="xd27e3965src">3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter is recited in General Miller&rsquo;s report to be from
&ldquo;President Lopez, of the Federal Government of Visayas.&rdquo;
General Miller then wrote Otis begging permission to attack on the
ground that upon the success of the expedition he was in charge of
&ldquo;depends the future speedy yielding of insurrectionary movements
in the islands.&rdquo; War correspondent Bass, who was on the ground at
the time, also wrote his paper: &ldquo;The effect on the natives will
be incalculable all over the islands.&rdquo; But General Otis was
trying to help <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>Mr. McKinley nurse the treaty through the Senate
on the idea that there weren&rsquo;t going to be any
&ldquo;insurrectionary movements in the islands,&rdquo; that all dark
and misguided conspiracies of selfishly ambitious leaders looking to
such impious ends would fade before the sunlight of Benevolent
Assimilation.</p>
<p>Cautioning Otis against any clash at Iloilo, Mr. McKinley wired
January 9th: &ldquo;Conflict would be most unfortunate, considering the
present. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Time given the insurgents cannot injure us,
and must weaken and discourage them. They will see our benevolent
purpose, etc.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3976src" href=
"#xd27e3976" name="xd27e3976src">4</a></p>
<p>The Iloilo fiasco did indeed furnish to the insurgent cause aid and
comfort at the psychologic moment when it most needed encouragement to
bring things to a head. It presented a spectacle of vacillation and
seeming cowardice which heartened the timid among the insurgents and
started among them a general eagerness for war which had been lacking
before. In one of his bulletins<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3983src"
href="#xd27e3983" name="xd27e3983src">5</a> to Otis, General Miller
tells of two boats&rsquo; crews of the 51st Iowa landing on January
5th, and being met by a force of armed natives who &ldquo;asked them
their business and warned them off,&rdquo; whereupon they heeded the
warning and returned to their transport. This regiment had then been
cooped up on their transport continuously since leaving San Francisco
November 3d, previous, sixty-three days. They were kept lying off
Iloilo until January 29th, and then brought back to Manila and landed,
after eighty-nine days aboard ship, all idea of taking Iloilo before
the Senate should act having been abandoned.</p>
<p>The Benevolent Assimilation Proclamation was received by cable in
cipher, at Manila, December 29th, and as soon as it had been written
out in long hand <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156"
name="pb156">156</a>]</span>General Otis hurried a copy down to General
Miller at Iloilo by a ship sailing that day, so that General Miller
might &ldquo;understand the position and policy of our
government.&rdquo; But he forgot to tell Miller to conceal the policy
for the present.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3992src" href="#xd27e3992"
name="xd27e3992src">6</a> So the latter, on January 1st, not only sent
a copy of it to the &ldquo;President of the Federal Government of
Visayas,&rdquo; Mr. Lopez,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3998src" href=
"#xd27e3998" name="xd27e3998src">7</a> but <i>in the note of
transmittal</i> he &ldquo;asked,&rdquo; says his report, &ldquo;that
they <i>permit</i> the entry of my troops.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4010src" href="#xd27e4010" name="xd27e4010src">8</a> What a fatal
mistake! Here was a proclamation representing all the &ldquo;majesty,
dominion, and power&rdquo; of the American Government, signed by the
President of the United States, in terms asserting immediate, absolute,
and supreme authority, and the natives were &ldquo;asked&rdquo; if they
would &ldquo;permit&rdquo; its enforcement. General Miller&rsquo;s
report says that he also had the proclamation &ldquo;translated into
Spanish and distributed to the people.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4015src" href="#xd27e4015" name="xd27e4015src">9</a> &ldquo;The
people laugh at it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The insurgents call us
cowards and are fortifying at the point of the peninsula, and are
mounting old smooth-bore guns left by the Spaniards. They are
intrenching everywhere, are bent on having one fight, and are confident
of victory. <i>The longer we wait before the attack the harder it will
be to put down the insurrection.</i>&rdquo; This is especially
interesting in the light of President McKinley&rsquo;s justification of
the wisdom of temporizing&mdash;on the idea that delay would weaken the
insurgents and could not hurt us. &ldquo;<i>Let no one convince
you</i>,&rdquo; writes Miller to Otis on January 5th, &ldquo;that
peaceful means can settle the difficulty here.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span></p>
<p>The appeal to Otis to permit commencement of operations was without
avail. Otis was the Manila agent of the Aldrich Old Guard in the
Senate, in charge of the pending treaty. He would simply send the
disgusted Miller messages not to be hasty, assuring him that the firing
of a shot at Iloilo would mean the precipitation of general conflict
about Manila and all over the place, and that this would be &ldquo;most
disappointing to the President of the United States, who continually
urges extreme caution and no conflict.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4028src" href="#xd27e4028" name="xd27e4028src">10</a></p>
<p>The Administration was counting senatorial noses at the time, and
that its anxiety was justified is apparent from the fact already noted,
that on the final vote whereby the treaty was ratified it had but one
vote to spare. So General Miller sat sunning himself on the deck of his
transport, and watching the insurgents working like ants at their
fortifications, and vainly wishing his 2500 men could get ashore at
least long enough to stretch themselves a bit. John F. Bass,
correspondent for <i>Harper&rsquo;s Weekly</i>, left Iloilo, returned
to Manila, and wrote his paper on January 23d: &ldquo;I returned to
Manila well knowing that there was nothing more to be done in Iloilo
until the Senate voted on the Treaty of Peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the eighth day after General Miller had asked permission of the
Iloilo village Hampdens to enforce the orders of the President of the
United States, the &ldquo;Federal Government of the Visayas,&rdquo;
through its President, Se&ntilde;or Lopez, finally deigned to notice
Mr. McKinley&rsquo;s proclamation. It said under date of January
9th:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">General: We have the high honor of having received
your message, dated January 1st, of this year, enclosing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>letter of President McKinley. You say in one
clause of your message: &ldquo;As indicated in the President&rsquo;s
cablegram, under these conditions the inhabitants of the island of
Panay ought to obey the political authority of the United States, and
they will incur a grave responsibility if, after deliberating, they
decide to resist said authority.&rdquo; So the council of state of this
region of Visayas are, at this present moment, between the authority of
the United States, that you try to impose on us, and the authority of
the central government of Malolos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then follows this remarkable statement of the case for the
Filipinos:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The supposed authority of the United States began with
the Treaty of Paris, on the 10th of December, 1898. <i>The authority of
the Central Government of Malolos is founded in the sacred and natural
bonds of blood, language, uses, customs, ideas, (and)
sacrifices.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e4054src" href="#xd27e4054"
name="xd27e4054src">11</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Otis was fond of throwing cold water on any particularly
eloquent Filipino <i>insurrecto</i> document he had occasion to put in
his reports by saying that Mabini was &ldquo;the brains of&rdquo; the
Malolos Government&mdash;meaning the only brains it had<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4064src" href="#xd27e4064" name=
"xd27e4064src">12</a>&mdash;and that he probably wrote such document,
whatever it might be. But here is a piece of real eloquence,
originating away down in the Visayan Islands, as far away from Malolos
as Colonel Stark and his &ldquo;Green Mountain Boys&rdquo; were from
Washington and Hamilton in 1776 and after. What then is the explanation
of composition so forceful in its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159"
href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>impassioned simplicity, and
in the light of subsequent events, so pathetic? There is but one
explanation. It came from the heart. It was the cry of the Soul of
Humanity seeking its natural affiliations. It was the language of what
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s early state papers always used to call the
&ldquo;legitimate aspirations of&rdquo; his people&mdash;legitimate
aspirations which we later strangled. The reason of the writer&rsquo;s
earnestness is that a few months later he helped do some of the
strangling. Thirteen years afterwards, a thorough acquaintance with the
Filipino side of the matter, derived from an examination of the
information which has been gradually accumulated and published by our
government during that time, causes him to say, &ldquo;Father forgive
me, for I knew not what I did.&rdquo; The 35,000 volunteers of 1899
knew nothing about the Filipinos or their side of the case. We were
like the deputy sheriff who goes out with a warrant duly issued to
arrest a man charged with unlawful breach of the peace. It is not his
business to inquire whether the man is guilty or not. If the man
resists arrest, he takes the consequences.</p>
<p>On the second day after the above defiance of the President of the
United States was served up to General Miller, that gallant officer
having dutifully swallowed it, sent an officer ashore on a diplomatic
mission. The name and rank of this military ambassador were Acting
Assistant Surgeon Henry DuR. Phelan, who clearly appears to have been a
man of keen insight and considerable ability. His written report to
General Miller of what transpired is a document of permanent interest
and importance to the annals of men&rsquo;s struggles for free
institutions.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4071src" href="#xd27e4071"
name="xd27e4071src">13</a> It states that at the meeting the spokesman
of the Filipinos, Attorney Raimundo Melliza, began by saying that
&ldquo;all the Americans <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href=
"#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>owned was Manila.&rdquo; That was
unquestionably true, so our ambassador, it seems, did not gainsay it.
Dr. Phelan suggested that the Americans had sacrificed lives and money
in destroying the power of Spain. The spokesman, Attorney Melliza,
replied that &ldquo;<i>they also</i> had made great sacrifice in lives,
<i>and that they had a right to their country</i> which they had fought
for, and that we are here now to take from them what they had won by
fighting; <i>that they had been our allies, and we had used them as
such</i>.&rdquo; Dr. Phelan&rsquo;s report goes on to say: &ldquo;I
replied that military occupation was a necessity for a time,
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and that as soon as order was assured it would be
withdrawn *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. <i>They smiled at this.</i>&rdquo; Well they
might. Fourteen years have elapsed since then, and the law-making power
of the United States has never yet declared whether the American
occupation of the Philippine Islands is to be temporary, like our
occupation of Cuba was, or permanent, like the British occupation of
Egypt is. True, Dr. Phelan said &ldquo;military&rdquo; occupation, but
the smile was provoked by the suggestion of <i>temporariness</i>. After
the committee smiled, they remarked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We have fought for independence and feel that we have
the power of governing and need no assistance. <i>We are showing it
now. You might inquire of the foreigners if it is not so.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Phelan&rsquo;s report proceeds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">They stated that their orders were not to allow us to
disembark, and that they were powerless to allow us to come in without
express orders from their government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In regard to the Treaty of Paris, the spokesman, Lawyer Melliza,
said: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">International law forbids a nation to make a contract
in regard to taking the liberties of its colonies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lawyer Melliza was wrong. If he had said &ldquo;the law of
righteousness,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;international law,&rdquo; his
proposition, thus amended, would have been incontrovertible. On
September 19, 1911, one of the great newspapers of this country, the
<i>Denver Post</i>, sent out to the members of the Congress of the
United States, and to &ldquo;The Fourth Estate&rdquo; also, the
newspaper editors, a circular letter proposing that we sell the
Philippine Islands to Japan. A member of the United States Senate sent
this answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I do not favor your proposition. Selling the Islands
means selling the inhabitants. The question of traffic in human beings,
whether by wholesale or retail, was forever settled by the Civil
War.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About the same time a leading daily paper of Georgia had an
editorial on the <i>Denver Post&rsquo;s</i> proposition, the most
conspicuous feature of which was that <i>Japan was too poor to pay us
well</i>, should we contemplate selling the Filipinos to her, so it was
no use to discuss the matter at length.</p>
<p>No; Lawyer Melliza&rsquo;s proposition has no standing in
international law <i>yet</i>. But it has with what Mr. Lincoln&rsquo;s
First Inaugural called &ldquo;the better angels of our nature,&rdquo;
if we stop to reflect.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature of the Phelan report to General Miller
is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I asked Lawyer Melliza if Aguinaldo said we could
occupy the city would they agree to it. He replied most emphatically
that they would.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that time, in January, 1899, while the debate on the treaty was
in progress in the United States Senate, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>there was hardly a
province in that archipelago where you would not have encountered the
same inflexible adherence to the Aguinaldo government.</p>
<p>Dr. Phelan&rsquo;s report closes thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">At the conclusion of the meeting it was said that as
this question <i>involved the integrity of the entire republic</i>, it
could not be further discussed here, but must be referred to the
Malolos Government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is one other statement made by the spokesman of the Filipinos,
at their meeting with Dr. Phelan, which arrested and gripped my
attention. That it may interest the reader as it did me, it will need
but a word or so as preface. In the fall of that same year, 1899, when
my regiment, the 29th Infantry, U. S. Volunteers, reached the Islands,
it was supposed that the insurrection had about played out,
<i>i.e.</i>, that it had been &ldquo;beaten to a frazzle,&rdquo;
because the Filipinos no longer offered to do battle in force in the
open. Yet all that fall, and all through 1900 and after, a most
obstinate guerrilla warfare was kept up. Anywhere in the archipelago
you were liable to be fired on from ambush. At first we could not
understand this. Later we found out it was the result of an order of
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s, faithfully carried out, not to assemble in large
commands, but to conduct a systematic guerrilla warfare indefinitely.
We learned this by capturing a copy of the order, which was quite
elaborate. Dr. Phelan&rsquo;s report says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I told him [Melliza] that the city was in our power,
and that we could destroy it at any time *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. Lawyer
Melliza replied that he cared nothing about the city; that we could
destroy it if we wished *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. &ldquo;<i>We will withdraw to
the mountains and repeat the North American Indian warfare. You must
not forget that.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>Later, they did.</p>
<p>On January 15th, General Otis wrote General Miller<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e4172src" href="#xd27e4172" name="xd27e4172src">14</a> again
cautioning him against any clash at Iloilo, and saying of conditions at
Manila and Malolos: &ldquo;The revolutionary government is <i>very
anxious</i> for peaceful relations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three days later Senator Bacon saw the situation with clearer vision
from the other side of the world than General Otis could see it under
his nose, and said on the floor of the Senate on January 18th
concerning the conditions at Manila and Malolos:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">While there is no declaration of war, while there is
no avowal of hostile intent, with two such armies fronting each other
with such divers intents and resolves, it will take but a spark to
ignite the magazines which is to explode.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4185src" href="#xd27e4185" name="xd27e4185src">15</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spark was ignited on February 4, 1899, by a sentinel of the
Nebraska regiment firing on some Filipino soldiers who disregarded his
challenge to halt, and killing one of them. War once on, General Miller
was directed on February 10th, after he had lain in Iloilo harbor for
forty-four days, to take the city. So at last he gave written notice to
the insurgents in Iloilo demanding the surrender of the city and
garrison &ldquo;before sunset Saturday, the 11th instant&rdquo; and
requesting them to give warning to all non-combatants.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4193src" href="#xd27e4193" name=
"xd27e4193src">16</a> Thereupon the insurgents set fire to the city and
departed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the last chapter we saw the d&eacute;but of the
Benevolent Assimilation programme at Iloilo. We are now to observe it
at Manila. General Otis says in his report for 1899<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e4219src" href="#xd27e4219" name="xd27e4219src">1</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">After fully considering the President&rsquo;s
proclamation and the temper of the Tagalos with whom I was daily
discussing political problems and the friendly intentions of the United
States Government toward them, I concluded that there were certain
words and expressions therein, such as &ldquo;sovereignty,&rdquo;
&ldquo;right of cession,&rdquo; and those which directed immediate
occupation, etc., *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* which might be advantageously used by
the Tagalo war party to incite widespread hostilities among the
natives. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* It was my opinion, therefore, that I would be
justified in so amending the paper that the beneficent object of the
United States Government would be clearly brought within the
comprehension of the people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, he published a proclamation as indicated, on January
4th, at Manila. In a less formal communication concerning this
proclamation, viz., a letter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href=
"#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>to General Miller at Iloilo,
General Otis comes to the point more quickly thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">After some deliberation we put out one of our own
which it was believed would suit the temper of the people.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4235src" href="#xd27e4235" name=
"xd27e4235src">2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only thing in the Otis proclamation specifically directed toward
soothing &ldquo;the temper of the people&rdquo; was a hint that the
United States would, under the government it was going to impose,
&ldquo;appoint the representative men now forming the controlling
element of the Filipinos to civil positions of responsibility and
trust&rdquo; (p. 69). And this, far from soothing Filipino temper, was
interpreted as an offer of a bribe if they would desert the cause of
their country. The <i>bona fides</i> of the offer they did not doubt
for a moment. In fact it caught a number of the more timid prominent
men, especially the elderly ones of the ultraconservative element
preferring submission to strife. But the younger and bolder spirits
were faithful, many of them unto death, and all of them unto many
battles and much &ldquo;hiking.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4245src" href="#xd27e4245" name="xd27e4245src">3</a></p>
<p>General Otis&rsquo;s report goes on to tell how, about the middle of
January, after he had published his sugar-coated edition of the
presidential proclamation at Manila, it then at last occurred to him
that General Miller might have published the original text of it in
full at Iloilo, and, &ldquo;fearing that,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I
again despatched Lieut. Col. Potter to Iloilo&rdquo;&mdash;evidently
post-haste. But it appears that when the breathless Potter arrived, the
lid was already off. The horse had left <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>the stable and the
door was open, as we saw in the preceding chapter. However, as the Otis
report indicates in this connection (p. 67), copies of the original
McKinley proclamation, as published in full at Iloilo by General
Miller, were of course promptly forwarded by the insurgents at Iloilo
to the insurgent government at Malolos. So all that General Otis got
for his pains was detection in the attempt to conceal the <i>crucial
words</i> asserting American sovereignty in plain English. He tells us
himself that as soon as the Malolos people discovered the trick,
&ldquo;it [the proclamation] became&rdquo;&mdash;in the light of the
Otis doctoring&mdash;&ldquo;the object of venomous attack.&rdquo; His
report was of course written long after all these matters occurred, but
its language shows a total failure on the part of its author, even
then, to understand the cause of the bitterness he denominates
&ldquo;venom.&rdquo; This bitterness grew naturally out of what seemed
to the Filipinos an evident purpose of the United States to take and
keep the Islands and an accompanying unwillingness to acknowledge that
purpose, as shown by the conspicuous discrepancies between the original
text of the proclamation as published at Iloilo by General Miller, on
January 1st, and the modified version of it given out by General Otis
at Manila on January 4th. &ldquo;The ablest of the insurgent
newspapers,&rdquo; says he (p. 69), &ldquo;which was now issued at
Malolos and edited by the uncompromising Luna *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* attacked
the policy *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* as declared in the proclamation, and its
assumption of sovereignty *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* with all the vigor of which
he was capable.&rdquo; The nature of Editor Luna&rsquo;s philippics is
not described by General Otis in detail, the only specific notion we
get of them being from General Otis&rsquo;s echo of their tone, which,
he tells us, was to the effect that &ldquo;everything tended simply to
a change of masters.&rdquo; But in another part of the Otis
<i>Report</i> (p. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167"
name="pb167">167</a>]</span>163) we find an epistle written about that
time by one partisan of the revolution to another, whose key-note,
given in the following extracts, was doubtless in harmony with the Luna
editorials:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We shall not have them (Filipinos enough to conduct a
decent government) in 10, 20, or a 100 years, because the Yankees will
never acknowledge the aptitude of an &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; race to
govern the country. Do not dream that when American sovereignty is
implanted in the country the American office-holders will give up.
Never! If *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* it depends upon them to say whether the
Filipinos have sufficient men for the government of the country
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* they will never say it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is not the American who pretends that he would have done anything
but just what the Filipinos did, had he been in their place,
<i>i.e.</i>, fought to the last ditch for the independence of his
country, the rankest sort of a hypocrite? General Otis was a soldier,
and his views may have been honestly colored by his environment. But
how at this late date can any fair-minded man read the above extracts
illustrative of the temper in which the Filipinos went to war with us
without acknowledging the righteousness of the motives which impelled
them?</p>
<p>Aguinaldo promptly met General Otis&rsquo;s proclamation of January
4th by a counter-proclamation put out the very next day, in which he
indignantly protested against the United States assuming
<i>sovereignty</i> over the Islands. &ldquo;Even the women,&rdquo; says
General Otis (p. 70), &ldquo;in a document numerously signed by them,
gave me to understand that after the men were all killed off they were
prepared to shed their patriotic blood for the liberty and independence
of their country.&rdquo; General Otis actually intended this last as a
sly touch <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>of humor. But when we recollect Mr.
Millet&rsquo;s description (<a href="#ch4">Chapter IV</a>. <i>ante</i>)
of the women coming to the trenches and cooking rice for the men while
the Filipinos were slowly drawing their cordon ever closer about the
doomed Spanish garrison of Manila in July and August previous, fighting
their way over the ground between them and the besieged main body of
their ancient enemies inch by inch, while Admiral Dewey blockaded them
by sea, General Otis&rsquo;s sly touch of humor loses some of its
slyness. &ldquo;The insurgent army also,&rdquo; he says (p. 70),
&ldquo;was especially affected *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and only awaited an
opportunity to demonstrate its invincibility in war with the United
States troops *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* whom it had commenced to insult and
charge with cowardice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The benighted condition of the insurgents in this regard was
directly traceable to the Iloilo fiasco. It was that, principally,
which made the insurgents so foolishly over-confident and the
subsequent slaughter of them so tremendous. Further on in his report
General Otis says, with perceptible petulance, in summing up his case
against the Filipinos:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The pretext that the United States was about to
substitute itself for Spain *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* was resorted to and had its
effect on the ignorant masses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking of his own modified version of the Benevolent Assimilation
Proclamation, General Otis says (p. 76):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">No sooner was it published than it brought out a
virtual declaration of war from, in this instance at least, the
wretchedly advised President Aguinaldo, who, on January 5th, issued the
following</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;giving the reply proclamation in full. No man can read the
Otis report itself without feeling that if he, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>reader, had been playing Aguinaldo&rsquo;s hand
he would have played it exactly as Aguinaldo did. To General Otis the
government at Malolos&mdash;&ldquo;their Malolos arrangement,&rdquo; he
used to call it&mdash;seemed quite an impudent little
<i>opera-bouffe</i> affair, &ldquo;a tin-horn government,&rdquo; as
Senator Spooner suggested in the same debate on the treaty, in which he
called his rugged and fiery friend from South Carolina, Senator
Tillman, &ldquo;the Senator from Aguinaldo,&rdquo; and immediately
thereafter, with that engaging frankness that always so endeared him to
his colleagues on both sides of the Chamber, removed the sting from the
jest by admitting that neither he (Spooner), nor Tillman, nor anybody
else in the United States, knew anything about Aguinaldo or his
government. But in the calmer retrospect of many years after, we have
seen, through the official documents which have become available in the
interval, that said government was in complete and effective control of
practically the whole archipelago, and had the moral support of the
whole population at a time when our troops controlled absolutely
nothing but the two towns of Manila and Cavite. Therefore, when we read
in the Aguinaldo proclamation such phrases as, &ldquo;In view of this,
I summoned a council of my generals and asked the advice of my cabinet,
and in conformity with the opinion of both bodies I&rdquo; did so and
so; &ldquo;My government cannot remain indifferent to&rdquo; this or
that act of the Americans assuming sovereignty over the islands;
&ldquo;Thus it is that my government is disposed to open hostilities
if&rdquo; etc.; they do not sound to us so irritatingly bombastic as
they did to General Otis, distributed under his nose as the
proclamation containing them at once was, by thousands, throughout a
city of which he was nominally in possession, but nine-tenths of whose
300,000 <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>inhabitants he was obliged to believe in
sympathy with the insurgents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My government,&rdquo; says the Aguinaldo proclamation,
&ldquo;rules the whole of Luzon, the Visayan Islands, and a part of
Mindanao.&rdquo; Except as to Mindanao, which cut absolutely no figure
in the insurrection until well toward the end of the guerrilla part of
it, we have already examined this claim and found by careful analysis
that it was absolutely true by the end of December, 1898.</p>
<p>After a rapid review of how he had been aided and encouraged in
starting the revolution against the Spaniards by Admiral Dewey, and
then given the cold shoulder by the army when it came,
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s manifesto says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">It was also taken for granted that the American forces
would necessarily sympathize with the revolution which they had managed
to encourage, and which had saved them much blood and great hardships;
and, above all, we entertained absolute confidence in the history and
traditions of a people which fought for its independence and for the
abolition of slavery, and which <i>posed as the champion and liberator
of oppressed peoples</i>. <i>We felt ourselves under the safeguard of a
free people.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That this statement also was authorized by the facts is evident from
the minutes of the Hong Kong meeting of May 4th, already noticed,
presided over by Aguinaldo, and called to formulate the programme for
the insurrection he was about to sail for the Philippines to
inaugurate, in which, after much discussion among the revolutionary
leaders it was agreed that while they must be prepared for all possible
contingencies, yet,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">if Washington proposes to carry out the fundamental
principles of its constitution, it is most improbable that an
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>attempt will be made to colonize the Filipinos
or annex them.<a class="noteref" id="n199.1src" href="#n199.1" name=
"n199.1src">4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, the Aguinaldo proclamation of January 5th suggests with a
briefness which Filipino familiarity with the great mass of facts
already laid before the reader in the preceding chapters made
appropriate, all the causes for which the Malolos Government was ready,
if need be, to declare war, and winds up by boldly serving General Otis
with notice that if the Americans try to take Iloilo and the Visayan
Islands &ldquo;my government is disposed to open
hostilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On January 9th President McKinley cabled out to General Otis asking
if it would help matters to send a commission out to explain to the
Filipinos our benevolent intentions. This idea thus suggested
materialized, a few weeks later, in the Schurman Commission, of which
more anon. The next day, January 10th, General Otis answered endorsing
the sending of &ldquo;commissioners of tact and discretion,&rdquo; and
adding:<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n199.1">4</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Great difficulty is that leaders cannot control
ignorant classes.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4339src" href="#xd27e4339"
name="xd27e4339src">5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a matter of fact the leaders were leading. They were not
<i>arguing</i> with the tide. They were merely <i>riding the crest</i>
of it. Actually, General Otis would have stopped &ldquo;The Six Hundred
Marseillaise Who Knew How to Die&rdquo;&mdash;the ones whose march to
Paris, according to Thomas Carlyle, inspired the composition of the
French national air, &ldquo;The Marseillaise&rdquo;&mdash;and tried to
parley with the head of the column on the idea of getting them to
abandon their enterprise and disperse to their several homes. He also
says, in the cablegram under consideration: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">If peace kept for several days more immediate danger
will have passed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, he was holding off the calf as best he could pending
the ratification of the treaty. From the text itself, however, of
General Otis&rsquo;s report, it is clear enough, that even he was
getting anxious to give the Filipinos a drubbing as soon as the treaty
should be safely passed. Referring to a message from the President
enjoining avoidance of a clash with the Filipinos he says (p. 80):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The injunction of his Excellency the President of the
United States to exert ourselves to preserve the peace had an excellent
effect upon the command. Officers and men *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* <i>were</i>
restless under the restraints *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* imposed, and
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* eager to avenge the insults received. <i>Now</i> they
submit very quietly to the taunts and aggressive demonstrations of the
insurgent army who continue to throng the streets of the business
portion of the city.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the lamb kick the lion viciously in the face, and observe the
lion as he first lifts his eyes heavenward and says meekly: &ldquo;Thy
will be done. This is Benevolent Assimilation&rdquo;; and then turns
them Senate-ward and murmurs: &ldquo;I cannot stand this much longer,
kind sirs. Say when!&rdquo; The way war correspondent John F. Bass puts
the situation about this time in a letter to his paper,
<i>Harper&rsquo;s Weekly</i>, was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Jimmie Green<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4377src" href=
"#xd27e4377" name="xd27e4377src">6</a> bites his lip, hangs on to
himself, and finds comfort in the idea that his time will come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After Aguinaldo&rsquo;s ultimatum of January 5th about fighting if
we took Iloilo, General Otis refrained from taking Iloilo, and
continued to communicate with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173"
href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>insurgent chieftain,
appointing commissioners to meet commissioners appointed by him. These
held divers and sundry sessions, whose only result was to kill time, or
at least to mark time, while the Administration was getting the treaty
through the Senate. The object of these meetings is thus set forth in
the military order of January 9, 1899, appointing the Otis portion of
the Joint High Parleying Board:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">To meet a commission of like number appointed by
General Aguinaldo, and to confer with regard to the situation of
affairs and to arrive at a mutual understanding of the intent,
purposes, aim, and desires of the Filipino people and the people of the
United States, that peace and harmonious relations between these
respective peoples may be continued.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4388src" href="#xd27e4388" name="xd27e4388src">7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The minutes of the first meeting of this board, prepared by the
Spanish-speaking clerk or recorder, recite the above declared purpose
<i>verbatim</i>, in all its verbosity, and then go on to say that our
side asked</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">That the commissioners appointed by General Aguinaldo
give their opinion as to what <i>were</i> the purposes, aspirations,
aims, and desires of the people of the archipelago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next paragraph is almost Pickwickian in its unconscious
terseness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">To this request the commissioners appointed by General
Aguinaldo made response that in their opinion the aspirations,
purposes, and desires of the Philippine people might be summed up in
<i>two words</i> &ldquo;Absolute Independence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course even General Otis does not reproduce this laconic answer
as part of his petulant summing up of how little the Filipinos knew,
before the outbreak of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href=
"#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>February 4th, as to what they
really wanted. He merely alludes to it as being of record elsewhere. It
is one o&pound; the various pieces of jetsam and flotsam that have
floated from the sea of those great events to the shores of government
publications since. The minutes of these meetings may be found among
the hearings before the Senate Committee of 1902.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4422src" href="#xd27e4422" name="xd27e4422src">8</a></p>
<p>General Otis&rsquo;s report complains that Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
commissioners did not know what they wanted, &ldquo;could not give any
satisfactory explanation&rdquo; of the &ldquo;measure of
protection&rdquo; they wanted, they having declared that they would
greatly prefer the United States to establish a protectorate over them
to keep them from being annexed by some other power. But he fails to
state, which is a fact shown by the minutes of the meeting of January
14 (p. 2721), that the Filipino commissioners did say that this was a
question which would only be reached between their government and ours
when the latter should agree to officially recognize the former. To
quote their exact language, which is rather clumsily translated, they
said: &ldquo;The aspiration of the Filipino people is the independence
with the restrictions resulting from the conditions which its
government may agree with the American, <i>when the latter agree to
officially recognize the former</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is perfectly clear from the voluminous minutes of the proceedings
that the Filipinos were only seeking <i>some declaration of the purpose
of our government</i> which would satisfy their people that the
programme was something more than a mere change of masters. &ldquo;They
begged,&rdquo; says General Otis (p. 82), &ldquo;for <i>some tangible
concession</i> from the United States Government&mdash;one <i>which
they could present to the people</i> and which might serve to allay
excitement.&rdquo; General Otis of course <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb175" href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>had no authority to
bind the government and so could make no promise. But the day this
Otis-Aguinaldo parleying board had its second meeting, January 11th,
and probably with no more knowledge of its existence than the reader
has of what is going on in the Fiji Islands at the moment he reads
these lines, Senator Bacon introduced in the United States Senate some
resolutions which were precisely the medicine the case required and
precisely the thing the Filipinos were pleading for. These resolutions
concluded thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">That the United States hereby disclaim any disposition
or intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over
said islands except for the pacification thereof, and assert their
determination when an independent government shall have been duly
erected therein entitled to recognition as such, to transfer to said
government, upon terms which shall be reasonable and just, all rights
secured under the cession by Spain, and to thereupon leave the
government and control of the islands to their people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They were a twin brother to the Teller Cuban resolution which was
incorporated into the resolution declaring war against Spain, being
<i>verbatim</i> the same, except with the necessary changes of name, of
&ldquo;islands&rdquo; for &ldquo;island,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>On January 18th, while the futile parleying board aforesaid was
still futilely parleying at Manila, Senator Bacon made an argument in
the Senate in support of his resolution, whose far-sighted
statesmanship, considered in relation to the analogies of its historic
setting, most strikingly reminds us of Burke&rsquo;s great speech on
conciliation with America delivered under similar circumstances nearly
a century and a quarter earlier. After alluding to the naturalness of
the apprehension of the Filipinos &ldquo;that it is the purpose of the
United <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>States Government to maintain permanent dominion
over them,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4461src" href="#xd27e4461"
name="xd27e4461src">9</a> Senator Bacon urged:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The fundamental requirement in these resolutions is
that the Government of the United States will not undertake to exercise
<i>permanent dominion</i> over the Philippine Islands. The resolutions
are intentionally made broad, so that <i>those who agree on that
fundamental proposition may stand upon them</i> even though they may
differ materially as to a great many other things relative to the
future course of the government in connection with the Philippine
Islands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Senator Bacon then quoted the following from some remarks Senator
Foraker had previously made in the course of the great debate on the
treaty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I do not understand anybody to be proposing to take
the Philippine Islands with the idea and view of permanently holding
them. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The President of the United States does not, I
know, and no Senator in this chamber has made any such statement;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">If the views expressed by the learned Senator from
Ohio in his speech *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* are those upon which we are to act,
there is very little difference between us; and there will be no future
contention between us *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* if we can have an authoritative
expression from <span class="sc">The Law-Making Power</span> of the
United States in a joint resolution that such is the purpose of the
future.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4490src" href="#xd27e4490" name=
"xd27e4490src">10</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Says the Holy Scripture: &ldquo;A word spoken in season, how good is
it!&rdquo; Had the Bacon resolutions passed the United States Senate in
January, 1899, we never would have had any war with the
Filipinos.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4497src" href="#xd27e4497" name=
"xd27e4497src">11</a> They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href=
"#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>would have presented at the
psychologic moment the very thing the best and bravest of the Filipino
leaders were then pleading with General Otis for, something
&ldquo;tangible,&rdquo; something &ldquo;which they could present to
their people and which would allay excitement,&rdquo; by allaying the
universal fear that we were going to do with them exactly as all other
white men they had ever heard of had done with all other brown men they
had ever heard of under like circumstances, viz., keep them under
permanent dominion with a view of profit.</p>
<p>In his letter accepting the nomination for the Presidency in 1900,
Mr. McKinley sought to show the Filipinos to have been the aggressors
in the war by a reference to the fact that the outbreak occurred
<i>while the Bacon resolution was under discussion</i> in the Senate.
This hardly came with good grace from an Administration whose friends
in the Senate had all along opposed not only the Bacon resolution but
also all other resolutions frankly declaratory of the purpose of our
government. The supreme need of the hour then was, and the supreme need
of every hour of every day we have been in the Philippines since has
been, &ldquo;an authoritative expression from the law-making power of
the United States&rdquo;&mdash;not mere surmises of a President,
confessedly devoid of binding force, but an <i>authoritative expression
from the law-making power</i>, declaratory of the purpose of our
government with regard to the Philippine Islands. Secretary of War Taft
visited Manila in 1907 to be present at the opening of the Philippine
Assembly. In view of the universal longing which he knew existed for
some definite authoritative declaration as to whether our government
intends to keep the Islands permanently or not, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I cannot speak with authority *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. The
policy to be pursued with respect to them is, therefore, ultimately for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>Congress to determine. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I have no
authority to speak for Congress in respect to the ultimate disposition
of the Islands.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4518src" href="#xd27e4518"
name="xd27e4518src">12</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This bitter disappointment of the public expectation and hope of
something definite, certainly did not lessen the belief of the
Filipinos that we have no notion of ever giving them their
independence. Had the Senate known what the Filipino commissioners were
so earnestly asking of the Otis commissioners in January, 1899, the
Bacon resolution would probably have passed. In fact it is demonstrable
almost mathematically that, had the Administration&rsquo;s friends in
the Senate allowed that resolution to come to a vote before the
outbreak of February 4th, instead of filibustering against it until
after that event, it would have passed. As stated in the foot-note, the
roll-call on the final vote on it, which was not taken until February
14th, showed a tie&mdash;29 to 29, the Vice-President of the United
States casting the deciding vote which defeated it. Much dealing with
real life and real death has blunted my artistic sensibilities to
thrills from the mere pantomime of the stage. But as here was a vote
where, had a single Senator who voted No voted Aye, some 300,000,000 of
dollars, over a thousand lives of American soldiers killed in battle,
some 16,000 lives of Filipino soldiers killed in battle, and possibly
100,000 Filipino lives snuffed out through famine, pestilence, and
other ills consequent on the war, would have been saved, I can not
refrain from reproducing the vote&mdash;perhaps the most uniquely
momentous single roll-call in the parliamentary history of
Christendom<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4526src" href="#xd27e4526" name=

<p>In January, 1899, the out-and-out land-grabbers had not yet made
bold to show their hand, the friends of the treaty confining themselves
to the alleged shame of doing as we had done with Cuba, on account of
the supposed semi-barbarous condition of &ldquo;the various tribes out
there,&rdquo; leaving the possibility of profit to quietly suggest
<i>itself</i> amid the noisy exhortations of altruism. It was not until
after the milk of human kindness had been spilled in war that Senator
Lodge said at the Philadelphia National Republican Convention of
1900:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We make no hypocritical pretence of being interested
in the Philippines solely on account of others. We believe in Trade
Expansion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking (p. 82) of the meetings of what for lack of a better term I
have above called the Otis-Aguinaldo Joint High Parleying Board,
General Otis says in his report: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180"
href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Finally, the conferences became the object of
insurgent suspicion, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* amusement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Filipino newspapers called attention to the fact that large
reinforcements of American troops were on the way to Manila, and very
plausibly inferred that the parleying was for delay only. By January
26th the politeness of both the American and the Filipino commissioners
had been worn to a frazzle, and they adjourned, each recognizing that
the differences between them could ultimately be settled only on the
field of battle, in the event of the ratification of the treaty.</p>
<p>January 27th, General Otis cabled to Washington a letter from
Aguinaldo, of which he says in his report: &ldquo;I was surprised
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* because of the boldness with which he therein indicated
his purpose to continue his assumptions and establish their correctness
by the arbitrament of war&rdquo; (p. 84). General Otis was
&ldquo;surprised&rdquo; to the last. Aguinaldo&rsquo;s letter is not at
all surprising, though extremely interesting. It sends General Otis a
proclamation issued January 21st, announcing the publication of a
constitution modelled substantially after that of the United States,
even beginning with the familiar words about &ldquo;securing the
blessings of liberty, promoting the general welfare,&rdquo; etc., and
concludes with an expression of confident hope that the United States
will recognize his government, and a bold implication of determination
to fight if it does not. On the evening of February 4th an insurgent
soldier approaching an American picket failed to halt or answer when
challenged, and was shot and killed. Nearly six months of nervous
tension thereupon pressed for liberation in a general engagement which
continued throughout the night and until toward sundown of the next
day, thus finally unleashing the dogs of war. In <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>the
<i>Washington Post</i> of February 6, 1899, Senator Bacon is quoted as
saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I will cheerfully vote all the money that may be
necessary to carry on the war in the Philippines, but I still maintain
that we could have avoided a conflict with those people had the Senate
adopted my resolution, or a similar resolution <i>announcing our honest
intentions with regard to the Philippines</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Said the <i>New York Criterion</i> of February 11, 1899:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Whether we like it or not, we must go on slaughtering
the natives in the English fashion, and taking what muddy glory lies in
this wholesale killing until they have learned to respect our arms.
<i>The more difficult task of getting them to respect our intentions
will follow.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Washington Post</i> of February 6, 1899, may not have quoted
Senator Bacon with exactitude. But what the Senator <i>did</i> say on
the floor of the Senate <i>is</i> important, historically. Under date
of February 22, 1912, Senator Bacon writes me, in answer to an
inquiry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I enclose a speech made by me upon the subject in the
Senate February 27, 1899, and upon pages 6, 7, and 8 of which you will
find a statement of my position, and the reasons given by me therefor.
Of course you cannot go at length into that question in your narration
of the events of that day, but my position was that, while I did not
approve of the war, and did not approve of the enslavement of the
Filipinos, and while if I had my way I would immediately set them free,
at the same time, as war was then flagrant, and there were then some
twenty odd thousand American troops in the Philippine Islands, we must
either support them or leave them to defeat and death. I do not know
how far you can use anything then said by me, but if you make allusion
to the fact that I was willing to supply money <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>and
troops to carry on the war in the Philippines, I would be glad for it
to be accompanied by a very brief statement of the ground upon which I
based such action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above makes it unnecessary to quote at length from the speech
referred to, which may be found at pp. 2456 <i>et seq</i> of the
<i>Congressional Record</i> for February 27, 1899. However, there is
one passage in the speech to which I especially say Amen, and invite
all whose creed of patriotism is not too sublimated for such a common
feeling to join me in so doing. Senator Bacon will now state the
creed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The oft-repeated expression &ldquo;our country, right
or wrong&rdquo; has a vital principle in it, and upon that principle I
stand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Senator immediately follows his creed with these
commentaries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">In this annexation of the Philippine Islands through
the ratification of the treaty, and in waging war to subjugate the
Filipinos, I think the country, acting through constitutional
authorities, is wrong. But it is not for me to say because the country
has been committed to a policy that I do not favor and have opposed, in
consequence of which there is war, that I will not support the
government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the civilizing influence of Krag-Jorgensen rifles and the
moral uplift of high explosive projectiles, what our soldiers used to
call, with questionable piety, &ldquo;the fear of God,&rdquo; was
finally put into the hearts of the Filipinos, after much carnage by
wholesale in battle formation and later by retail in a species of
guerrilla warfare as irritating as it was obstinate. But they have
never yet learned to respect our intentions, because under the guidance
of three successive Presidents we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183"
href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>have studiously refrained
from any authoritative declaration as to what those intentions are. We
are loth to hark back to the only right course, a course similar to our
action in Cuba, because of the expense we have been to in the
Philippines. But we also know that the islands are and are likely to
continue, a costly burden, a nuisance, and a distinct strategic
disadvantage in the event of war; and that Mr. Cleveland was right when
he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The government of remote and alien people should have
no permanent place in the purposes of our national life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mistaken policy which involved us in a war to subjugate the
Filipinos, following our war to free the Cubans, will never stand
atoned for before the bar of history, nor can the Filipinos ever in
reason be expected to respect our intentions, until the law-making
power of the government shall have authoritatively declared what those
intentions are&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, what we intend ultimately to do with
the islands. Senator Bacon&rsquo;s resolutions of 1899 were, are, and
always will be the last word on the first act needed to rectify the
original Philippine blunder, &ldquo;announcing&rdquo; as they would, to
use the language attributed to their distinguished author by the
<i>Washington Post</i> of February 6, 1899, above-quoted, &ldquo;our
honest intentions with regard to the Philippines.&rdquo; So eager is
the exploiter to exploit the islands, and so apprehensive is the
Filipino that the exploiter will have more influence at Washington than
himself and therefore be able ultimately to bring about a practical
industrial slavery, that common honesty demands such a declaration. To
doctor present Filipino discontent with Benevolent Uncertainty is a
mere makeshift. The remedy the situation needs is simple, but as yet
untried&mdash;Frankness. The chief of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>causes of the present
discontent among the Filipinos with American rule is precisely the same
old serpent that precipitated the war thirteen years ago, to wit, lack
of a frank and honest declaration of our purpose. The trouble then lay,
and still lies, and, in the absence of some such declaration as that
proposed by the Bacon resolution, will always lie in what seemed then,
and still seems, to the Filipinos &ldquo;an evident purpose to keep the
islands and an accompanying unwillingness to acknowledge that
purpose.&rdquo; Some may object that one Congress cannot bind another.
The same argument would have killed the Teller amendment to the
declaration of war with Spain avowing our purpose as to Cuba. Such an
argument assumes that this nation has no sense of honor, and that it
should cling for a while longer to the stale Micawberism that the
Islands may yet pay, before it decides whether it will do right or not,
and signalizes such decision by formal announcement through Congress.
To men capable of such an assumption as the one just indicated, this
book is not addressed. Three successive Presidents, Messrs. McKinley,
Roosevelt, and Taft, have with earnest asseveration of benevolent
intention tried without success all these years to win the affections
of the Filipino people, and to make them feel that &ldquo;our flag had
not lost its gift of benediction in its world-wide journey to their
shores,&rdquo; as Mr. McKinley used to say. But the corner-stone of the
policy was laid before we knew anything about how the land lay, and on
the assumption, made practically without any knowledge whatever on the
subject, that the Filipino people were incapable of self-government.
The corner-stone of our Philippine policy has been from the beginning
precisely that urged by Spain for not freeing Cuba, viz., &ldquo;to
spare the people from the dangers of premature independence.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>The three Presidents named above have always
been willing to imply independence, but never to promise it. And the
unwillingness to declare a purpose ultimately to give the Filipinos
their independence has always been due to the desire to catch the vote
of those who are determined they shall never have it. In this
inexorable and unchangeable political necessity lies the essential
contemptibleness of republican imperialism, and the secret of why the
Filipinos, notwithstanding our good intentions, do not like us, and
never will under the present policy. How can you blame them?</p>
<p>Yet the more you know of the Filipinos, the better you like them.
Self-sacrificing, brave, and faithful unto death in war, they are
gentle, generous, and tractable in peace. Moreover, respect for
constituted authority, as such, is innate in practically every
Filipino, which I am not sure can be predicated concerning each and
every citizen of my beloved native land. And we can win the grateful
and lasting affection of the whole seven or eight millions of them any
day we wish to. How? Have done with vague, vote-catching Presidential
<i>obiter</i>, and through your Congress declare your purpose!

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The thing is on,&rdquo; said General Hughes,
Provost Marshal of Manila, to General Otis, at Malaca&ntilde;an palace,
on the night of February 4, 1899, about half past eight o&rsquo;clock,
as soon as the firing started.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4790src"
href="#xd27e4790" name="xd27e4790src">1</a> He was talking about
something which every American in Manila except General Otis had for
months frankly recognized as inevitable&mdash;the war.</p>
<p>On the day of the outbreak of February 4th, General Otis had under
his command 838 officers and 20,032 enlisted men, say in round numbers
a total of 21,000. Of these some 15,500 were State volunteers mostly
from the Western States, and the rest were regulars. All the volunteers
and 1650 of the regulars were, or were about to become, entitled to
their discharge, and their right was perfected by the exchange of
ratifications of the treaty of peace with Spain on April 11, 1899. The
total force which he was thus entitled to command for any considerable
period consisted of less than 4000. Of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>21,000 men on hand as aforesaid, on February
4th, deducting those at Cavite and Iloilo, the sick and wounded, those
serving in civil departments, and in the staff organizations, the
effective fighting force was 14,000, and of these 3000 constituted the
Provost Guard in the great and hostile city of Manila.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4800src" href="#xd27e4800" name="xd27e4800src">2</a>
Thus there were only 11,000 men, including those entitled to discharge,
available to engage the insurgent army, &ldquo;which,&rdquo; says
Secretary of War Root, &ldquo;was two or three times that number, well
armed and equipped, and included many of the native troops formerly
comprised in the Spanish army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the predicament into which General Otis&rsquo;s supremely
zealous efforts to help the Administration get the treaty through the
Senate by withholding from the American people the knowledge of facts
which might have put them on notice that they were paying $20,000,000
for a $200,000,000 insurrection, had brought us. This is not a tale of
woe. It is a tale of the disgust&mdash;good-humored, because
stoical&mdash;which finally found expression at the time in the army
song that heads this chapter, disgust at unnecessary sacrifice of
American life which could so easily have been prevented had General
Otis only revealed the real situation in time to have had plenty of
troops on hand. It is a requiem over those brave men of the Eighth Army
Corps from Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and the Western States that bore
the brunt of the early fighting, whose lives were needlessly sacrificed
in 1899 as the result of an unpreparedness for war due to anxiety not
to embarrass Mr. McKinley in his efforts to get the treaty through the
Senate, an unpreparedness which remained long unremedied thereafter in
order to conceal from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href=
"#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>people of the United States the
unanimity of the desire of the Filipinos for Independence.</p>
<p>It is quite true that none of our people then in the Islands
realized this unanimity in all its pathos at the outset, but it soon
became clear to everybody except the commanding general. It naturally
dawned on him last of all, because he did not visit the most reliable
sources of information, to wit, the battlefields during the fighting,
and therefore did not see how tenaciously the Filipinos fought for the
independence of their country. Moreover, General Otis tried to think
till the last along lines in harmony with the original theory of
Benevolent Assimilation. Hence Mr. Root&rsquo;s nonsense of 1899 and
1900 about &ldquo;the patient and unconsenting millions&rdquo;
dominated by &ldquo;the Tagalo tribe,&rdquo; which nonsense was
immensely serviceable in a campaign for the presidency wherein
antidotes for sympathy with a people struggling to be free were of
supreme practical political value. General Otis actually had Mr.
McKinley believing as late as December, 1899, at least, that the
opposition to a change of masters in lieu of Freedom was confined to a
little coterie of self-seeking politicians who were in the business for
what they could get out of it, and that the great majority would prefer
him, Otis, to Aguinaldo, as governor-general. It <i>is</i> difficult on
first blush to accept this statement as dispassionately correct, but
there is no escape from the record. Mr. McKinley said in his annual
message to Congress in December, 1899, in reviewing the direction he
gave to the Paris peace negotiations which ended in the purchase of the
islands, and the war with the Filipinos which had followed, and had
then been raging since February 4th previous, &ldquo;I had every reason
to believe, and <i>still believe</i> that the transfer of sovereignty
was in accordance with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href=
"#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>wishes and aspirations of the
great mass of the Filipino people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet every American soldier who served in the Philippines at the time
knows that Aguinaldo held the whole people in the hollow of his hand,
because he was their recognized leader, the incarnation of their
aspirations.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4824src" href="#xd27e4824"
name="xd27e4824src">3</a></p>
<p>During the presidential campaign of 1900, while the war with the
Filipinos was still raging, partisan rancour bitterly called in
question the sincerity of President McKinley&rsquo;s statement in his
annual message to Congress of December, 1899, that he then still
believed &ldquo;the transfer of sovereignty was in accord with the
wishes and aspirations of the great mass of the Filipino people,&rdquo;
on the ground that he must by the time he made that statement have
understood how grossly&mdash;however honestly&mdash;General Otis had
misled him as to the unanimity and tenacity of the Filipino purpose.
But it is only necessary to read Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s testimony before
the Senate Committee of 1902 to understand Mr. McKinley&rsquo;s
allusion in this same message to Congress of 1899 to &ldquo;the
sinister ambition of a few leaders,&rdquo; and this, once understood,
explains the other statement of the message. Admiral Dewey came home in
the fall of 1899 and undoubtedly filled Mr. McKinley with the estimate
of Aguinaldo which makes such painful reading in the Admiral&rsquo;s
testimony of 1902 before the Senate Committee, where he abused
Aguinaldo like a pick-pocket, so to speak, saying his original motive
was principally loot.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4832src" href=
"#xd27e4832" name="xd27e4832src">4</a> In the fall of 1899 Aguinaldo
had issued a proclamation claiming that Admiral Dewey originally
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>promised him independence, and Admiral Dewey had
bitterly denounced this as a falsehood, so that the Admiral always
cherished a very real resentment against the insurgent chief
thereafter. His estimate of the Filipino leader as being in the
insurrection merely for what he could get out of it was wholly
erroneous, and has long since been exploded, all our generals of the
early fighting and all Americans who have known him since being
unanimous that Aguinaldo was and is a sincere patriot; but it
undoubtedly explains Mr. McKinley&rsquo;s still clinging, in 1899, to
the notion derived from General Otis that the insurrection did not have
the moral and material backing of the whole Filipino people. The
Filipino leaders were familiar with the spirit of our institutions. The
men who controlled their counsels were high-minded, educated, patriotic
men. &ldquo;For myself and the officers and men under my
command,&rdquo; wrote General Merritt to Aguinaldo in August, 1898,
just after the fall of Manila, &ldquo;I can say that we have conceived
a high respect for the abilities and qualities of the Filipinos, and if
called upon by the Government to express an opinion, it will be to that
effect.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4841src" href="#xd27e4841"
name="xd27e4841src">5</a></p>
<p>The leaders believed that the American people did not fully
understand the identity of the Philippine situation with that in Cuba,
and that if they had, the treaty would not have been ratified. They
also knew the supreme futility of trying to get the facts before the
American people by peaceful means. And it was really with the abandon
of genuine patriotism that they plunged their country into war. We did
not know it then, but we do know it now. It would be simply
wooden-headed to affirm that they ever expected to succeed in a war
with us. Of course some of the <i lang="fr">jeunesse dor&eacute;e</i>,
as General Bell calls them in one of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>his early
reports,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4853src" href="#xd27e4853" name=
"xd27e4853src">6</a> grew very aggressive and insulting toward the
last. But the thinking men went into the war for independence in a
spirit of &ldquo;decent respect to the opinions of mankind,&rdquo; to
correct the impression General Otis had communicated to Mr. McKinley,
and through him to our people, in the hope that the more lives they
sacrificed in such a war (they risked&mdash;and many of them
lost&mdash;their own also), the nearer they would come to refuting the
idea that they did not know what they wanted. It was the only way they
had to appeal to C&aelig;sar, <i>i.e.</i>, to the great heart of the
American people. As the war grew more and more unpopular in the United
States, the impression was more and more nursed here at home that the
people did not really want independence, but were being coerced; and
that they were like dumb driven cattle. The striking similarity of
these suggestions to those by which tyranny has always met the
struggles of men to be free, did not seem to occur to the American
public. They were accepted as authoritative, being convenient also as
an antidote to sympathy. General Otis had suppressed such words as
&ldquo;sovereignty,&rdquo; &ldquo;protection,&rdquo; and the like from
his original sugar-coated edition of the Benevolent Assimilation
Proclamation, offering an elaborate cock-and-bull explanation of why he
did so. The Filipino answer to this took the form of a very clever
newspaper cartoon, representing an American in a carromata&mdash;a kind
of two-wheeled buggy&mdash;with a Filipino between the shafts pulling
it; which cartoon of course, never reached the United States. The
Filipinos had never heard the story on General Mahone about &ldquo;tie
yoh hoss an&rsquo; come in,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4861src"
href="#xd27e4861" name="xd27e4861src">7</a> but they had heard of the
jinrickshaws of Japan, and they had read in Holy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>Writ
and elsewhere of conquered people becoming hewers of wood and drawers
of water to invading conquerors. And they are <i>not</i> without a
sense of humor. It is a common mistake with many Americans&mdash;for
quite a few among us suffer intellectually from
over-sophistication&mdash;to suppose we monopolize all the sense of
humor there is, and that that alone is proof of a due sense of
proportion. At any rate, the Filipinos, with all due respect to General
Otis&rsquo;s good intentions, understood that &ldquo;sovereignty&rdquo;
and &ldquo;protection&rdquo; meant alien domination, so there was
nothing in the Otis notion that for them those words had a
&ldquo;<i>peculiar</i> meaning which might be advantageously used by
the Tagalo war party to incite,&rdquo; etc.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4878src" href="#xd27e4878" name="xd27e4878src">8</a></p>
<p>Having now gotten into a war on the theory that only a small
fraction of the Filipino people were opposed to a new and unknown yoke
in lieu of the old one, General Otis still continued to try to square
his theory with the facts. For many months he sat at his desk in Manila
cheerily waging war with an inadequate force, and retaining in the
service and on the firing line after their terms of enlistment expired,
under pretence that they consented to it willingly, a lot of fellows
from Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and the Western States, who had
volunteered for the war with Spain, with intent to kill Spaniards in
order to free Cubans, and not with intent to kill Filipinos for also
wanting to be free. Seeing nothing of the fighting himself, he of
course failed to get a correct estimate of the tenacity of the Filipino
purpose. No purpose is here entertained to suggest that any of those
early volunteers went around preaching mutiny, or feeling mutinous.
They did not originally like the Filipinos especially; furthermore,
they liked the Philippines less than they did the Filipinos,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>and they had a vague notion that some one had
blundered. But it was not theirs to ask the reason why. Besides, the
orders from Washington being not to clash with the Filipinos at least
until the treaty was ratified, the Filipino soldiers and subaltern
officers had been calling them cowards for some time with impunity. So
that as soon as the treaty was safely &ldquo;put over,&rdquo; they were
very glad to let off steam by killing a few hundred of them. But their
hearts were not in the fight, in the sense of clear and profound
conviction of the righteousness of the war. However, war is war, and
they were soldiers, and &ldquo;orders is orders,&rdquo; as Tommy Atkins
says. So let us turn to an honester, if grimmer, side of the
picture.</p>
<p>The first battle of the war began about 8:30 o&rsquo;clock on the
night of February 4th, and lasted all through that night and until
about 5 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of the next day. Our casualties
numbered about 250 killed and wounded. The insurgent loss was estimated
at 3000. &ldquo;Those of the insurgents will never be known,&rdquo;
says General Otis.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4890src" href=
"#xd27e4890" name="xd27e4890src">9</a> &ldquo;We buried 700 of
them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4895src" href="#xd27e4895"
name="xd27e4895src">10</a> There was fighting pretty much all around
Manila, for the insurgents had the city almost hemmed in. An arc of a
circle, broken in places possibly, but several miles long, drawn about
the city, would probably suggest the general idea of the enemy&rsquo;s
lines. They had been allowed to dig trenches without interference while
the debate in the Senate on the treaty was in progress, pursuant to the
temporary &ldquo;peace-at-any-price&rdquo; programme. The arc was
broken into smithereens by 5 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> of February
5th. When the morning of February 6th came Col. James F. Smith,
commanding the First Californias, was <i lang="la">non est
inventus</i>, and so was a large part of his regiment. &ldquo;No one
seemed to know definitely his location,&rdquo; says the Otis
<i>Report</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4910src" href="#xd27e4910"
name="xd27e4910src">11</a> As a matter of fact <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>he
had taken two battalions of his regiment and waded clean through the
enemy&rsquo;s lines, and had to be sent for to come back to form again
with the line of battle needed to protect the city. So the Californias
probably carried off the pick of the laurels of the first day&rsquo;s
fighting. General Anderson, commanding the First Division of the Eighth
Corps, threw them some very handsome well earned bouquets in his
report, stating also that their colonel had shown &ldquo;the very best
qualities of a volunteer officer&rdquo;&mdash;why he limited it to
&ldquo;volunteer&rdquo; does not appear, but is inferable from the
well-known disposition of all regulars to consider all volunteers
&ldquo;rookies&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4917src" href=
"#xd27e4917" name="xd27e4917src">12</a>&mdash;and recommended that he
be made a brigadier general, which shortly afterward was done.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4920src" href="#xd27e4920" name=
"xd27e4920src">13</a></p>
<p>It would be invidious to follow the various phases of the subsequent
early fighting, and single out one or more States<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4927src" href="#xd27e4927" name="xd27e4927src">14</a> and tell of
the hard earned and well deserved honors they won, because space
forbids a proper tribute to the heroism of all of them. As for the
regulars,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4930src" href="#xd27e4930" name=
"xd27e4930src">15</a> they were the same they were at Santiago de Cuba,
the same they always are anywhere you put them. When a newspaper man
would come around a regular regiment during the fighting before
Santiago he would be told that they had no news to give him, &ldquo;We
ain&rsquo;t heroes, we&rsquo;re regulars,&rdquo; they would say. After
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>the outbreak of February 4th, all our people did
well, acted nobly, &ldquo;Angels could no more.&rdquo; Neither could
devils, as shown by the losses inflicted on the enemy.</p>
<p>There was more fighting outside Manila during the next two or three
days, and when that was done the somewhat shattered insurgent legions
had recoiled to the distantly visible foot-hills, convinced that their
notion they could take Manila was very foolish and very rash.</p>
<p>At the town of Caloocan, some three or four miles out to the north
of Manila, were located the shops and round houses of the Manila and
Dagupan Railway, which runs from Manila in a northwesterly direction
about 120 miles to Dagupan, and was then the only railroad in the
archipelago. It was fed by a vast rich farming country, the great plain
of central Luzon. Naturally, the central plain which fed the railroad
that traversed it and kept its teeming myriads of small farmers in
touch with the great outside world was to be sooner or later, the
theatre of war. To seize transportation is instinctively the first
tactical move of a military man. Lieutenant-General Luna,
commander-in-chief, next to Aguinaldo, of the revolutionary forces, the
man whom later Aguinaldo had shot, was just then at Caloocan with 4000
men. So it fell to General MacArthur, commanding the Second Division of
the Eighth Corps, to move on Caloocan, which he did on February
10th.</p>
<p>John F. Bass, correspondent for <i>Harper&rsquo;s Weekly</i>,
writing from Manila a short time after this, describes this movement.
It was our first move away from the city of Manila. With a few masterly
strokes of the pen, which I regret there is not space to reproduce here
in full, Mr. Bass gives a vivid picture of the various engagements, and
of &ldquo;a background of burning villages, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>smoke, fire, shot, and shell, the ceaseless
tramp of tired and often bleeding feet,&rdquo; etc.
&ldquo;Heroism,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;became a matter of course and
death an incident.&rdquo; Finally his story pauses for a moment thus:
&ldquo;The natural comment is that all this is merely war&mdash;the
<i>business</i> of the soldier. True, nor do I think Jimmie Green [Mr.
Bass&rsquo;s name for our &ldquo;Tommy Atkins&rdquo;] is troubled with
heroics. He accepts the situation without excitement or hysterics.
<i>He has little feeling in this matter for his heart is not in this
fight.</i>&rdquo; Here brother Bass&rsquo;s moralizing ceases abruptly,
and the contagious excitement of the hour catches him, just as it
always does the average man under such circumstances:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">From La Loma church you may get the full view of our
long line crossing the open field, evenly, steadily, irresistibly, like
an inrolling wave on the beach *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. Watch the regiments go
forward, and form under fire, and move on and on, and you will exclaim:
&ldquo;Magnificent,&rdquo; and you will gulp a little and feel proud
<i>without exactly knowing why</i>. Then gradually the <i>power</i> of
that line will force itself upon you, and you will feel that you must
follow, that wherever that line goes you must go also. By and by you
will be sorry, but for the present the might of an American regiment
has got possession of you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anybody who has ever been with an American regiment in action knows
exactly how the man who wrote that felt. The American who has never had
the experience Mr. Bass describes above has missed one way of realizing
the majesty of the power of the republic whereof he is privileged to be
a citizen. For if there is one national trait which more than any other
explains the greatness of our country, it is the instinct for
organization, the fondness for self-multiplication to the
<i>n</i><sup>th</sup> power by intelligent co-operation with
one&rsquo;s fellows to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href=
"#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>a common end. Especially is the
experience in question inspiring where the example of the field
officers is particularly appropriate to the occasion. Take for instance
the following, concerning the conduct of Major J. Franklin Bell in this
advance on Caloocan, from the report of Major Kobbe, Commanding the
Artillery:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">As the right cleared the head of the ravine, I could
see Maj. J. F. Bell *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* leading a company of Montana troops
in front of the right *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* advancing, firing, toward
intrenchments *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. He was on a black horse to the last
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* leading and cheering the men. His work was most gallant
and *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* especially cheering to me.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4974src" href="#xd27e4974" name="xd27e4974src">16</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No mere scribe can magnify General Bell&rsquo;s matchless efficiency
in action, but it is certainly inspiring to contemplate. There are no
&ldquo;fuss and feathers&rdquo; about him. Yet his power, proven on
many a field in the Philippines, to kindle martial ardor by example,
suggests the ubiquitous &ldquo;Helmet of Navarre&rdquo; of Lord
Macaulay&rsquo;s poem.</p>
<p>A little later correspondent Bass develops what he meant by
&ldquo;by and by you will be sorry.&rdquo; You see it is not
comfortable business, this of hustling about among the dead and dying.
In the excitement, you are so liable to step on the face of some poor
devil you knew well, maybe a once warm friend. In this connection Mr.
Bass says: &ldquo;There is this difference between the manner in which
American and Filipino soldiers die. The American falls in a heap and
dies hard; the Filipino stretches himself out, and when dead is always
found in some easy attitude, generally with his head on his arms. They
die the way a wild animal dies&mdash;in just such a position as one
finds a deer or an antelope which one has shot in the woods.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span></p>
<p>So far as the writer is advised and believes, nobody who knows John
F. Bass ever suspected him of being a quitter. He must have been
reading the <i>London Standard</i>, which said about that time:
&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a little startling to find the liberators of Cuba
engaged in suppressing a youthful republic which claims the sacred
right of self-government.&rdquo; Bass had written his newspaper in
August previous, after observing how pluckily the Filipinos had fought
and licked the Spaniards: &ldquo;Give them their independence and
guarantee it to them.&rdquo; The overwhelming sentiment of the Eighth
Army Corps when we took the Philippines was against taking them; and
those who had kept informed knew that the Senate had ratified the
treaty by a majority only one more than enough to squeeze it through,
the vote having been 57 to 27, at least 56 being thus indispensable to
make the necessary constitutional two-thirds of the 84 votes cast; and
that Wall Street and the White Man&rsquo;s Burden or land-grabbing
contingent&mdash;&ldquo;Philanthropy and Five per cent,&rdquo; as
Secretary of the Treasury Lyman J. Gage put it at the time&mdash;were
responsible for these shambles Mr. Bass describes.</p>
<p>At this juncture some soft-headed gentleman asks: &ldquo;What is
this man who writes this book driving at? Is he trying to show that the
American soldiers in the Philippines in February, 1899, all wanted to
quit as soon as the war broke out?&rdquo; Not at all. In the first
place it hardly lay in American soldier nature to want to quit when
Aguinaldo was telling us &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t take your flag down
and out of these islands at once and promptly get out yourselves along
with it, I will proceed to kick <i>you</i> out and throw <i>it</i>
out.&rdquo; And in the next place, in the war with the Filipinos, as in
all other wars, fuel was added to the flame as soon as the war broke
out. Among the Americans, charges soon came into general <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>circulation and acceptance that the Filipinos
had planned (but been frustrated in) a plot looking to a general
massacre of all foreigners in Manila. This alleged plot was supposed to
have been scheduled to be carried out on a certain night shortly after
February 15, 1899. Among the Filipinos, on the other hand,
counter-charges soon followed, and met with general credence, that the
Americans made a practise of killing prisoners taken in battle,
including the wounded. Neither charge was ever proven, but both served
the purpose, at the psychologic moment, of possessing each side with
the desire to kill, which is the business of war. Let us glance briefly
at these recriminations.</p>
<p>Between pages 1916 and 1917 of <i>Senate Document 331</i>, part
2<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5007src" href="#xd27e5007" name=
"xd27e5007src">17</a> may be found a photo-lithograph of the celebrated
alleged order of the Filipino Revolutionary Government of February 15,
1899, to massacre all foreign residents of Manila. In his report for
1899<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5010src" href="#xd27e5010" name=
"xd27e5010src">18</a> General Otis himself describes this order as one
&ldquo;which for barbarous intent is unequalled in these modern times
in civilized warfare,&rdquo; and speaks of it as &ldquo;issued by the
Malolos Government through the responsible officer who had raised and
organized the hostile inhabitants within the city.&rdquo; After
Aguinaldo was captured in 1901, according to an account given by
General MacArthur to the Senate Committee in 1902, of a conversation
with the insurgent leader, the latter was shown a copy of this document
purporting to have been signed by General Luna, one of his generals. He
disclaimed having in any way sanctioned it, in fact disclaimed any
prior knowledge of it whatsoever,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5015src"
href="#xd27e5015" name="xd27e5015src">19</a> a disclaimer which General
MacArthur appears to have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href=
"#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>accepted as true, frankly and
entirely. At page 1890 of the same volume, Captain J. R. M. Taylor,
14th U. S. Infantry, a gallant soldier and an accomplished scholar, who
was in charge in 1901 of the captured insurgent records at Manila,
states that he was &ldquo;informed&rdquo; that the document was
originally &ldquo;signed by Sandico, then Secretary of the
Interior&rdquo; of the revolutionary government. Captain Taylor made an
attempt to run the matter down, but obtained no evidence convincing to
him. A like investigation by General MacArthur in 1901 had a like
result.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5023src" href="#xd27e5023" name=
"xd27e5023src">20</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, Major Wm. H. Bishop, of the 20th Kansas, was
credited in a soldier&rsquo;s letter written home, which first came to
light in this country, with killing unarmed prisoners during the
advance on Caloocan. The charges originated with a private of that
regiment. Major Bishop denied the charges.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5033src" href="#xd27e5033" name="xd27e5033src">21</a> An
investigation followed, in the course of which somebody made an
innuendo, or charge&mdash;it is not important which&mdash;that other
officers used their influence to prevent a full ventilation of the
matter, specifically, General Funston, then Colonel of the 20th Kansas,
and Major Metcalf, of the same regiment. These last two also made a
most vigorous general denial, and nothing whatever was established
against them. The whole matter was finally disposed of by being
forwarded to the War Department at Washington by General Otis on July
13, 1899, some six months after the occurrences alleged, with the
remark that he (General Otis) &ldquo;doubted the wisdom of a
court-martial&rdquo; of the soldier who had made the charge against
Major Bishop, &ldquo;as it would give the insurgent authorities a
knowledge of what was taking place, and they would assert positively
that our troops practised inhumanities, whether the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>charges could be proven or not&rdquo; and that
they would use the incident &ldquo;as an excuse to defend their own
barbarities.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5040src" href=
"#xd27e5040" name="xd27e5040src">22</a> The last endorsement on the
papers preceding General Otis&rsquo;s final endorsement was one by
Colonel Crowder, now (1912) Judge Advocate General of the United States
Army, in which he said: &ldquo;I am not convinced from a careful
reading of this report, that Private Brenner has made a false charge
against Captain Bishop&rdquo;; adding that &ldquo;considerations of
public policy, sufficiently grave to silence every other demand,
require that no further action be taken in this case.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5045src" href="#xd27e5045" name=
"xd27e5045src">23</a> The &ldquo;considerations of public policy&rdquo;
were of course those indicated in General Otis&rsquo;s final
endorsement on the papers, already quoted. They were compellingly
controlling, in my judgment, independently of the merits. Washing
one&rsquo;s soiled linen in public is never advisable, and placing a
weapon in your enemy&rsquo;s hand in time of war is at least equally
unwise. Some shreds of this once much mooted matter doubtless still
linger in the public memory. It has been thus briefly ventilated here
solely to trace the genesis of the bitterness of that war, and of
numerous later barbarities avenged in kind. The bitterness thus early
begun grew as the war went on, until every time a hapless Filipino
peasant soldier speaking only two or three words of Spanish would
falsely explain, when captured, that he was a non-combatant, an
<i>amigo</i> (friend), it usually at once filled the captor with vivid
recollections of slain comrades, and of rumored or sometimes proven
mutilation of their bodies after death, and these reflections would at
once fill him with a yearning desire to blow the top of the
<i>amigo&rsquo;s</i> head off, whether he yielded to the desire or not.
Of no instance where he did so yield am I aware. But I do know that the
invariable statement of all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href=
"#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>Filipinos unarmed and un-uniformed
when captured, to the effect that they were <i>amigos</i>, became to
the American soldier not remotely dissimilar to the waving of a red rag
at a bull. Of course this was also due, largely, to the guerrilla
practice of hiding guns when hard-pressed and actually plunging at once
into some make-believe agricultural pursuit. As for Major Bishop, it is
inconceivable to me that he gave any order to kill unarmed prisoners.
Even admitting for the sake of the argument that he is a fiend, he is
not a fool. As a matter of fact, he was a brave soldier, as all the
reports show, and is a reputable lawyer, having many warm friends whose
opinion of any man would command respect anywhere. The truth of the
whole matter probably is that just before going into battle, when our
troops were in an ugly temper by reason of the rumors of barbarities
alleged to have been perpetrated by the enemy, or contemplated by him,
the word was passed along the line to &ldquo;Take no more prisoners
than we have to,&rdquo; and that that thought originated with some
irresponsible private soldier of the line inflamed by stories of
mutilation of our dead or of maltreatment of our wounded. Such a
&ldquo;word,&rdquo; so passed from man to man, can, in the heat of
conflict, very soon evolve into something having for practical purposes
all the force and effect of an order.</p>
<p>Through the foregoing, and like causes, including the &ldquo;water
cure,&rdquo; later invented to persuade <i>amigos</i> to discover the
whereabouts of hidden insurgent guns or give information as to the
movements of the enemy,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5067src" href=
"#xd27e5067" name="xd27e5067src">24</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>our war with the
Filipinos became, before it was over, a rather &ldquo;dark and
bloody&rdquo; affair, accentuated as it was, from time to time, by
occasional Filipino success in surprising detachments from ambush, or
by taking them unawares and off their guard in their quarters, and
eliminating them, the most notable instance of the first being the
crumpling of a large command of the 15th Infantry by General Juan
Cailles, in southern Luzon, and the most indelibly remembered and
important example of the second being the massacre of the 9th Infantry
people at Balangiga, in Samar, in the fall of 1901. Certainly more than
one American in that long-drawn-out war did things unworthy of any
civilized man, things he would have believed it impossible, before he
went out there, ever to come to. Personally, I have heard, so far as I
now recollect, of comparatively few barbarities perpetrated by
Filipinos on captured American soldiers. Barbarities on their side
seemed to have been reserved for those of their own race whom they
found disloyal to the cause of their country. Personally I have never
seen the water-cure administered. But I once went on a confidential
mission by direction of General MacArthur, in the course of which I
reported first, on arriving in the neighborhood of the contemplated
destination, to a general officer of the regular army who is still such
to-day.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5072src" href="#xd27e5072" name=
"xd27e5072src">25</a> That night the general was good enough to extend
the usual courtesy of a cot to sleep on, in the headquarters building.
Toward dusk I went to dine with a certain lieutenant, also of the
regular army.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5075src" href="#xd27e5075"
name="xd27e5075src">26</a> As we approached <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>the
lieutenant&rsquo;s quarters a sergeant came up with a prisoner, and
asked instructions as to what to do with him. The lieutenant said:
&ldquo;Take him out and find out what he knows. <i>Do you
understand</i>, Sergeant?&rdquo; The sergeant saluted, answered in the
affirmative, and moved away with his prisoner. We went in to the
lieutenant&rsquo;s quarters, and while at dinner heard groans outside.
I said &ldquo;What is that, Jones?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5084src" href="#xd27e5084" name="xd27e5084src">27</a> Jones said:
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the water-cure he&rsquo;s giving that <i lang=
"es">hombre</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5090src" href="#xd27e5090"
name="xd27e5090src">28</a> Want to see it?&rdquo; I replied that I
certainly did not. Returning that night to the general&rsquo;s
headquarters, after breakfast the next morning I met my friend Jones
coming out of the general&rsquo;s office. I said: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter, what are you doing here,&rdquo; he having mentioned the
evening before an expedition planned for the morrow. He said:
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve just had a talk with the general to see if I
could get my resignation from the army accepted?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; was the reply,
&ldquo;that &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (designating the prisoner of the
night before by a double barrelled epithet) &ldquo;died on me last
night.&rdquo; Just how the matter was hushed up I have never known, but
Jones was never punished. More than one general officer of the United
States Army in the Philippines during our war with the Filipinos at
least winked at the water-cure as a means of getting information, and
quite a number of subalterns made a custom of applying it for that
purpose. It was practically the only way you could get them to betray
their countrymen. Did I report the incident to General MacArthur?
Certainly not. It was the business of the general commanding the
district. The water-cure, though very painful, was seldom fatal, and
when not fatal was almost never <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205"
href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>permanently damaging, and it
was about the only way to shake the loyalty of the average Filipino and
make him give information as to hidden insurgent guns, guerrilla bands,
etc. It was a part of Benevolent Assimilation.</p>
<p>Let us now return to the early battlefields about Manila which we
left, initially, to analyze the extreme bitterness of the feeling
between the combatants that very early began to develop.</p>
<p>We left war correspondent John F. Bass among the dead and dying on
one of these fields, supposedly musing on the White Man&rsquo;s Burden,
or Land-Grabbing, or Trust-for-Civilization theory, or whatever it was
that moved the fifty-seven senators whose votes had ratified the treaty
by a majority of just one more than the constitutionally necessary
two-thirds.</p>
<p>The reason the writer lays so much stress on Mr. Bass&rsquo;s
letters to <i>Harper&rsquo;s Weekly</i> on the early fighting in the
Philippines, is because his remarks come direct from the battlefield,
and are, as it were, <i>res gest&aelig;</i>. They were made <i>dum
fervet opus</i>, to use a law Latin phrase which in plain English means
&ldquo;while the iron is hot.&rdquo; They reflect more or less
accurately the feelings of the men whose deeds he was recording. He,
and O. K. Davis, now Washington correspondent of the <i>New York
Times</i>, and John T. McCutcheon, of Chicago, the now famous
cartoonist (who was with Dewey in the battle of Manila Bay), and Robert
Collins, now London correspondent of the Associated Press, and
&ldquo;Dick&rdquo; Little of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>,&mdash;a little
man about six feet three,&mdash;and lots of other good men and true,
were all through that fighting, and we will later come to an issue of
personal veracity between them and General Otis which culminated in the
retirement from office of Secretary of War Alger, and ought to have
resulted in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>the recall of General Otis, but did not, because
to have acknowledged what a blunderer General Otis had been and to have
relieved him from command, as he should have been relieved, would have
been to &ldquo;swap horses crossing a stream,&rdquo; as Mr. Lincoln
used to put it in declining to change generals during a given campaign.
The object here is to bring out the truth of history as to how the men
who bore the brunt of the early fighting felt about it. Testimony as to
what the officers and men of the army said would be of no value,
because a complaining soldier&rsquo;s complaints are too often only a
proof of &ldquo;cold feet.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5119src"
href="#xd27e5119" name="xd27e5119src">29</a></p>
<p>These newspaper men, not under military orders, were daily risking
their lives voluntarily, just to keep the American public informed, and
the American public were kept in darkness and only vouchsafed bulletins
giving them the progressive lists of their dead and wounded, and this
last only on demand made upon Secretary Alger by the people of
Minnesota, the Dakotas, etc., through their senators. The War
Department did not want the people to know, did not want to admit
itself, how plucky, vigorous, and patriotic the resistance was. The
period of the fighting done by the State Volunteers from February until
fall, when public opinion finally forced the Administration to send
General Otis an adequate force, is slurred by Secretary of War Root in
his report for 1899. I do not mean that it was slurred intentionally.
But the Philippines were a long way off, and Mr. Root and Mr. McKinley
naturally relied for their information on their commanding general on
the spot. There were gallant deeds done in the Philippines by those
Western fellows of the State regiments which volunteered for the war
with Spain, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>that would have made the little fighting around
Santiago look like&mdash;well, to borrow from &ldquo;Chimmie&rdquo;
Fadden&rsquo;s fertile vocabulary, &ldquo;like 30 cents.&rdquo; But
General Otis was not in a position to get the thrill of such things
from his office window, so very few of them were given much prominence
by him in his despatches to the Adjutant-General of the army. This was
wise enough from a political standpoint, seeing that a presidential
campaign was to ensue in 1900 predicated on the proposition that
American sovereignty was &ldquo;in accord with the wishes and
aspirations of the great mass of the Filipinos,&rdquo; to use the words
of the President&rsquo;s message to Congress of December, 1899.</p>
<p>Caloocan was taken by General MacArthur on February 10th. The
natural line of advance thereafter was of course up the railroad,
because the insurgents held it, and needed it as much as we would.
Throughout February there were engagements too numerous to mention. The
navy also entertained the enemy whenever he came too near the shores of
Manila Bay. One incident in particular is worthy of note, and worthy of
the best traditions of the navy. I refer to the conduct of Assistant
Engineer Emory Winship off Malabon, March 4, 1899. Malabon is five
miles north of Manila, on the bay, not far from Caloocan. On the day
named, a landing party of 125 men from the U. S. S. <i>Bennington</i>
went ashore near Malabon to make photographs, in aid of navy gunnery,
of certain entrenchments and buildings that had been struck by shells
from the <i>Monadnock</i>. They foolishly failed to throw out scouts
ahead of their column, and were suddenly greeted with a withering fire
from a whole regiment of insurgents who had seen them first and lain in
wait for them. They retired with considerably more haste than they had
gone forth. The insurgents advanced, firing, at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>double quick, toward the comparative handful of
Americans, and would undoubtedly have killed the last man jack of them,
but Engineer Winship, who had been left in charge of the tug that
brought the landing party shoreward, to keep up steam, saw the
situation and promptly met it. He unlimbered a 37<i>mm.</i> Hotchkiss
revolving machine gun which stood in the bow of the tug, and opened up
with accurate aim on the advancing regiment of Filipinos. Naturally he
at once became a more important target than the retreating body.
Nevertheless, he kept pumping lead into that long howling murderous
advancing brown line until, when within two hundred yards of where the
tug lay, the line recoiled and retreated, and the landing party got
safely back to the ship. It was, literally, a case of saving the lives
of more than a hundred men, by fearless promptness and dogged tenacity
in the intelligent and skilful performance of duty. The awnings of the
tug were torn in shreds by the enemy&rsquo;s rain of bullets, and her
woodwork was much peppered. Winship was hit five times, and still
carries the bullets in his body, having been retired on account of
disability resulting therefrom, after being promoted in recognition of
his work.</p>
<p>Soon after March 25th, General MacArthur, commanding the Second
Division of the Eighth Army Corps, advanced from Caloocan up the
railroad to Malolos, the insurgent capital, some twenty miles away.
Malolos was taken March 31st. Our February killed were six officers and
seventy-one enlisted men, total seventy-seven, and a total of 378
wounded. By the end of March the list swelled to twelve officers and
127 enlisted men killed, total 139, and a total of 881 wounded, making
our total casualties, as reported April 1st, 1020. Also 15% of the
command, or about <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209"
name="pb209">209</a>]</span>2500, were on sick report on that date from
heat prostrations and the like.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5143src"
href="#xd27e5143" name="xd27e5143src">30</a> For these and other
reasons, farther advance up the railroad was halted for a while.</p>
<p>Meantime, General Lawton, with his staff, consisting of Colonel
Edwards, Major Starr, and Captains King and Sewall, &ldquo;the big
four&rdquo; they were called, had come out from New York City by way of
the Suez Canal, bringing most welcome reinforcements, the 4th and 17th
Infantry. These people arrived between the 10th and the 22d of March.
What happened soon after, as a result of their arrival, must now become
for a brief moment, a part of the panorama, the lay of the land General
Lawton first swept over being first indicated.</p>
<p>Luzon is practically bisected, east and west, by the Pasig River and
a lake out of which it flows almost due west into Manila Bay, Manila
being at the mouth of the river. Under the Spaniards, all Luzon north
of the Pasig had been one military district and all Luzon south of the
Pasig another. The Eighth Army Corps always spoke of northern Luzon as
&ldquo;the north line,&rdquo; and of southern Luzon as &ldquo;the south
line.&rdquo; The lake above mentioned is called the Laguna de Bay. It
is nearly as big as Manila Bay, which last is called twenty odd miles
wide by thirty long. On the map, the Laguna de Bay roughly resembles a
half-moon, the man in which looks north, the western horn being near
Manila, and the eastern near the Pacific coast of Luzon. General Otis
had learned that at a place called Santa Cruz, toward the eastern end
of the Laguna de Bay, there were a lot of steam launches and a Spanish
gun-boat, which, if captured, would prove invaluable for river fighting
and transportation of supplies along the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>Rio Grande de
Pampanga and the other streams that watered the great central plain
through which the railroad ran and which would have to be occupied
later. So as soon as possible after General Lawton arrived and the
necessary men could be spared, he was sent with 1500 troops to seize
and bring back the boats in question. Of course the country he should
overrun would have to be overrun again, because there were not troops
enough to spare to garrison and hold it. But for the present, the
launches would help. This expedition was successful, leaving the head
of the lake nearest Manila on April 9th, and returning April 17th. It
met with some good hard fighting on the way, sweeping everything before
it of course, inflicting considerable loss, and suffering some. General
Lawton&rsquo;s report mentions, among other officers whose conspicuous
gallantry and efficiency in action attracted his attention, Colonel
Clarence R. Edwards, now Chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs of the
War Department, of whose conduct in the capture of Santa Cruz on the
morning of April 10th, he says: &ldquo;No line of battle could have
been more courageously or intelligently led.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e5155src" href="#xd27e5155" name="xd27e5155src">31</a> The
resistance was pretty real to Colonel Edwards then, <i>i.e.</i>, the
Benevolent Assimilation was quite strenuous, and it continued to be so
until his great commander was shot through the breast in the forefront
of battle in the hour of victory in December thereafter, and the
colonel came home with the general&rsquo;s body. Since then the colonel
has soldiered no more, but has remained on duty at Washington, the
birthplace of the original theory that the Filipinos welcomed our rule,
charged with the duty of yearning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211"
href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>over the erring Filipino who
thinks he can govern himself but is mistaken, and also with the still
more difficult task of trying to live up to the original theory as far
as circumstances will permit. As a matter of fact, the Filipinos would
probably have gotten along much better than the Cubans if we had let
General Lawton do there what he and General Wood were set to work doing
in Cuba shortly after Santiago fell. Public opinion is a very dangerous
thing to trifle with, and when, in September, 1899, there was a story
going the rounds of the American newspapers that Lawton, the hero of El
Caney, the man who had reflected more glory on American arms in
striking the shackles of Spain from Cuba than any other one soldier in
the army, had called the war in the Philippines &ldquo;this accursed
war,&rdquo; the War Department got busy over the cable to General Otis
and obtained from him a denial that General Lawton had made such a
remark. But the public knew its Lawton and what he had done in Cuba,
and had a suspicion there might be some truth in the rumor. So the War
Department cabled out saying &ldquo;Newspapers say Lawton&rsquo;s
denial insufficient,&rdquo; and then repeating the words attributed to
him. So General Otis sent another denial that filled the bill.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5165src" href="#xd27e5165" name=
"xd27e5165src">32</a> Of course General Lawton made no such remark. He
was too good a soldier. It would have demoralized his whole command.
But I served under him in both hemispheres, and I will always believe
that he had a certain amount of regret at having to fight the Filipinos
to keep them from having independence, when they were a so much
likelier lot, take it all in all, than the Cubans we saw about
Santiago. Moreover, I believe that had it not been then too late to ask
him, he would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>have subscribed to the opinion Admiral Dewey had
cabled home the previous summer: &ldquo;These people are far superior
in their intelligence and more capable of self-government than the
natives of Cuba, and I am familiar with both races.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the expedition down the lake, General Lawton went on
&ldquo;The North Line.&rdquo; So let us now turn thither also. For
wherever Lawton was, there was fighting.</p>
<p>In the latter half of April, General MacArthur advanced north along
the railroad, and took Calumpit, where the railroad crosses the Rio
Grande, on April 28th. This was the place where under cover of
&ldquo;the accurate concentrated fire of the guns of the Utah Light
Artillery commanded by Major Young&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5181src" href="#xd27e5181" name="xd27e5181src">33</a> a few
Kansas men with ropes tied to their bodies swam the river in the face
of a heavy fire from the enemy, fastened the ropes to some boats on the
enemy&rsquo;s side, and were pulled back in the boats, by their
comrades, to the side they had come from; the Kansans then crossing the
river under the lead of the gallant Funston, and driving the enemy from
his trenches. The desperate bravery of the performance, like so many
other things General Funston did in the Philippines, was so superb that
one forgets how contrary it was to all known rules of the game of war.
If it was Providence that saved Funston and his Kansans from
annihilation, certainly Providence was ably assisted on that occasion
by Major Young and his Utah Battery.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5187src" href="#xd27e5187" name="xd27e5187src">34</a></p>
<p>Shortly after this General MacArthur entered San <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>Fernando, the second insurgent capital, which is
forty miles or so up the railroad from Manila.</p>
<p>During the month of May General Lawton kept the insurgents busy to
the east of the railroad, between it and the Pacific coast range,
taking San Isidro, whither the third insurgent capital was moved after
Malolos fell, on May 17th. Here he made his headquarters for a time, as
did General MacArthur at San Fernando.</p>
<p>It had been supposed that practically the whole body of the
insurgent army was concentrated in the country to the north of Manila,
but this proved a mistake. They now began to threaten Manila from the
country south of the Pasig. Says General Otis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The enemy had become again boldly demonstrative at the
South and it became necessary to throw him back once more.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5204src" href="#xd27e5204" name=
"xd27e5204src">35</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Lawton was directed to concentrate his troops in the country
about San Isidro, turn them over to the command of some one else, and
come to Manila to organize for a campaign on the south line. The
<i>details</i> of this expedition belong to a military history, which
this is not. The expedition left its initial point of concentration
near Manila on June 9th. Its great event was the battle of Zapote River
on June 13th. Along this river in 1896 the insurgents had gained a
great victory over the Spaniards. They had trenches on the farther side
of the river which they deemed impregnable. General Lawton attacked
them in these intrenchments June 13th. At three o&rsquo;clock that
afternoon he wired General Otis at Manila giving him an idea of the
battle and stating that the enemy was fighting in strong force and with
determination. At 3:30 o&rsquo;clock he wired: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We are having a beautiful battle. Hurry up ammunition;
we will need it;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and at 4 o&rsquo;clock:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We have the bridge. It has cost us dearly. Battle not
yet over. It is a battle however.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5225src"
href="#xd27e5225" name="xd27e5225src">36</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was in this battle of Zapote River that Lieutenant William L.
Kenly, of the regular artillery, did what was perhaps the finest single
bit of soldier work of the whole war,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5232src" href="#xd27e5232" name="xd27e5232src">37</a> in
recognition of which his conduct in the battle was characterized as
&ldquo;magnificent&rdquo; by so thorough a soldier as General Lawton,
who recommended him to be brevetted for distinguished gallantry in the
presence of the enemy, with this remark:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">As General Ovenshine says, speaking of Lieutenant
Kenly and his battery, &ldquo;This is probably <i>the first time in
history</i> that a battery has been advanced and <i>fought without
cover within thirty yards of</i> strongly manned
trenches.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5244src" href="#xd27e5244"
name="xd27e5244src">38</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For what he did on that occasion, Kenly ought to have had a medal of
honor, which, except life insurance and a good education, is the finest
legacy any government can enable a soldier to bequeath to his children.
If the war had been backed by the sentiment of the whole country, as
the Spanish War was, he would have gotten it. As it was, the only thing
he ever got for it, so far as the writer is advised, was to have his
name spelt wrong in an account of the incident in the only book
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>wherein there has yet been attempted a record of
the many deeds of splendid daring that marked the only war into which
this nation ever blundered.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5254src" href=
"#xd27e5254" name="xd27e5254src">39</a></p>
<p>While there were divers and sundry movements of our troops hither
and thither, and much sacrifice of life, after General Lawton&rsquo;s
Zapote River campaign in June, no substantial progress was made in
conquering and occupying the Islands until the fall following the
Zapote River campaign above mentioned, when the twenty-five regiments
of volunteers were organized and sent out. All that was done until
then, after the capture of San Fernando, may be summed up broadly, by
saying that we protected Manila and held the railroad, as far as we had
fought our way up it. It is true that the city of Iloilo had been
occupied on February 11th, the city of Cebu shortly afterward, the
island of Negros, an oasis of comparative quiet in a great desert of
hostility, a little later; also that a small Spanish garrison at the
little port of Jolo in the Mohammedan country near Borneo had also been
relieved by a small American force on the 19th of May. But these
irresolute movements accomplished nothing except to deprive our force
at the front of about 4000 men and to awaken the Visayan Islands to
active and thorough organization against us.</p>
<p>Preparatory to an understanding of the fall campaign, in which
patchwork and piecemeal warfare was superseded by the real thing, it
will now be necessary to consider the political&mdash;or let us call
it, the politico-military&mdash;aspect of the first half year of the
war.</p>
<p>General Otis&rsquo;s folly had led him to advise Washington as early
as November, 1898, that he could get along with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>25,000 troops,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5268src" href="#xd27e5268" name="xd27e5268src">40</a> and the
Otis under-estimate of the resistance we would meet if we took the
Islands had undoubtedly influenced Mr. McKinley in deciding to take
them. Twenty-five thousand troops was only 5000 more than General Otis
had with him at the time he made the recommendation, and signified that
he was not expecting trouble. The Treaty of Paris was signed on
December 10, 1898, and on December 16th, President McKinley&rsquo;s
Secretary of War informed Congress that 25,000 troops would be enough
for the Philippines.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5273src" href=
"#xd27e5273" name="xd27e5273src">41</a> When the treaty was ratified
February 6, 1899, the war in the Philippines had already broken out. On
March 2, 1899, two days before the 55th Congress expired, in fact on
the very day that Congress appropriated the $20,000,000 to pay Spain
for the Islands, an act was passed authorizing the President to enlist
35,000 volunteers to put down the insurrection in the Islands. The term
of enlistment of these volunteers was to expire June 30, 1901. As the
New Thought people would say &ldquo;Hold the Thought!&rdquo; June 30,
1901, is the end of our government&rsquo;s fiscal year. That date, the
date of expiration of the enlistment of the volunteer army raised under
the act of March 2, 1899, is a convenient key to the whole history of
the American occupation of the Philippines since the outbreak of our
war with the Filipinos, February 4, 1899, including the titanic efforts
of the McKinley Administration in the latter half of 1899 and the first
half of 1900 to retrieve the Otis blunders; the premature resumption by
Judge Taft, during and in aid of Mr. McKinley&rsquo;s campaign for the
Presidency in 1900, of the original McKinley Benevolent Assimilation
programme, on the theory, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href=
"#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>already wholly exploded by a long
and bitter war, that the great majority of the people welcomed American
rule and had only been coerced into opposing us; and the premature
setting up of the Civil Government on July 4, 1901. No candid mind
seeking only the truth of history can fail to see that when President
McKinley sent the Taft Commission to the Philippines in the spring of
1900, part of their problem was to facilitate Mr. McKinley in avoiding
later on any further call for volunteers to take the place of those
whose terms would expire June 30, 1901. The amount of force that has
been needed to saddle our government firmly on the Filipino people is
the only honest test by which to examine the claim that it is unto them
as Castoria unto children. In February, 1899, the dogs of war being
already let loose, President McKinley had resumed his now wholly
impossible Benevolent Assimilation programme, by sending out the
Schurman Commission, which was the prototype of the Taft Commission, to
yearningly explain our intentions to the insurgents, and to make clear
to them how unqualifiedly benevolent those intentions were. The scheme
was like trying to put salt on a bird&rsquo;s tail after you have
flushed him. This commission was headed by President Schurman, of
Cornell University. It arrived in March, armed with instructions as
benevolent in their rhetoric as any the Filipinos had ever read in the
days of our predecessors in sovereignty, the Spaniards. And the
commission were of course duly astounded that their publication had no
effect. The Filipinos in Manila tore them down as soon as they were put
up. The instructions clothed the commission with authority to yield
every point in issue except the only one in dispute&mdash;Independence.
On this alone they were firm. But so were the people who had already
submitted the issue to the arbitrament <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>of war. Of course the
Schurman Commission, therefore, accomplished nothing. It held frequent
communication with the enemy in the field and came near an open rupture
with General Otis, who was nominally a member of it. But even that
unwise man knew war when he saw it, and knew the futility of trying to
mix peace with war. War being hell, the sooner &rsquo;tis over the
better for all concerned. After Professor Schurman had been quite
optimistically explaining our intentions for about three months, under
the tragically mistaken notion Mr. McKinley had originally derived from
General Otis that the insurrection had been brought about by &ldquo;the
sinister ambition of a few leaders,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5283src" href="#xd27e5283" name="xd27e5283src">42</a> General
Otis wired Washington, on June 4th, &ldquo;Negotiations and conferences
with insurgent leaders cost soldiers&rsquo; lives and prolong our
difficulties,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5286src" href=
"#xd27e5286" name="xd27e5286src">43</a> adding with regard to the
Schurman Commission: &ldquo;Ostensibly it will be supported
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* here, and to the outside world gentle peace shall
prevail,&rdquo; but intimating that he would be very much gratified if
the Department would allow him to handle the enemy, and stop Dr.
Schurman from having their leaders come in under flags of truce to
parley. After that Dr. Schurman&rsquo;s activities seem to have been
confined to the less mischievous business of gathering statistics. His
mistake was simply the one he had brought with him, derived from
President McKinley. He came back home, however, thoroughly satisfied
that the Filipinos did of a verity want the independence they were
fighting for, and quite as sure that republics should not have colonies
as General Anderson&rsquo;s experience had previously made him. It has
long been known throughout the length and breadth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span>of
the United States that Dr. Schurman is in favor of Philippine
independence.</p>
<p>On June 26th, just thirteen days after the Zapote River fight had
stopped the insurgents on the south line from threatening almost the
very gates of the city of Manila itself, General Otis had another
attack of optimism. On that date he wired Washington: &ldquo;Insurgent
cause may collapse at any time.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5296src" href="#xd27e5296" name="xd27e5296src">44</a> Finally,
the war correspondents at Manila, wearied with the military press
censorship whereby General Otis had so long kept the situation from the
people at home, with his eternal &ldquo;situation-well-in-hand&rdquo;
telegrams, got together, inspired no doubt by the example of the
Roosevelt round robin that had rescued the Fifth Army Corps from Cuba
after the fighting down there, and prepared a round robin of their
own&mdash;a protest against further misrepresentation of the facts.
This they of course knew General Otis would not let them cable home.
However, they asked his permission to do so, the committee appointed to
beard the lion in his den being O. K. Davis, John T. McCutcheon, Robert
Collins, and John F. Bass. General Otis threatened to &ldquo;put them
off the island.&rdquo; This did not bother them in the least. General
Otis told the War Department afterwards that he did not punish them
because they were &ldquo;courting martyrdom,&rdquo; or words to that
effect. As a matter of fact, they were merely determined that the
American people should know the facts. That of &ldquo;putting them off
the island&rdquo; was just a fussy phrase of &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; Otis,
long familiar to them. They were under his jurisdiction. But they were
Americans, and reputable gentlemen, and he knew he was responsible for
their right treatment. After General Otis had duly put the expected
veto on the proposed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220"
name="pb220">220</a>]</span>cablegram of protest, the newspaper men
sent their protest over to Hong Kong by mail, and had it cabled to the
United States from there. It was published in the newspapers of this
country July 17, 1899. A copy of it may be found in any public library
which keeps the bound copies of the great magazines, in the <i>Review
of Reviews</i> for August, 1899, pp. 137&ndash;8. It read as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The undersigned, being all staff correspondents of
American newspapers stationed in Manila, unite in the following
statement:</p>
<p>We believe that, owing to official despatches from Manila made
public in Washington, the people of the United States have not received
a correct impression of the situation in the Philippines, but that
those despatches have presented an ultra-optimistic view that is not
shared by the general officers in the field.</p>
<p>We believe the despatches incorrectly represent the existing
conditions among the Filipinos in respect to internal dissension and
demoralization resulting from the American campaign and to the brigand
character of their army.</p>
<p>We believe the despatches err in the declaration that &ldquo;the
situation is well in hand,&rdquo; and in the assumption that the
insurrection can be speedily ended without a greatly increased
force.</p>
<p>We think the tenacity of the Filipino purpose has been
under-estimated, and that the statements are unfounded that volunteers
are willing to engage in further service.</p>
<p>The censorship has compelled us to participate in this
misrepresentation by excising or altering uncontroverted statements of
facts on the plea that &ldquo;they would alarm the people at
home,&rdquo; or &ldquo;have the people of the United States by the
ears.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The men of the pen had been so long under military rule and had seen
so much of courts-martial that their <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>document savored of
military jurisprudence. After making the above charges, it set forth
what it called &ldquo;specifications.&rdquo; These were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Prohibition of hospital reports; suppression of full
reports of field operations in the event of failure; numbers of heat
prostrations in the field; systematic minimization of naval operations;
and suppression of complete reports of the situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paper was signed by John T. McCutcheon and Harry Armstrong,
representing the Chicago <i>Record</i>; O. K. Davis and P. G.
MacDonnell, representing the New York <i>Sun</i>; Robert M. Collins,
John P. Dunning, and L. Jones, representing the Associated Press; John
F. Bass and William Dinwiddie, representing the New York <i>Herald</i>;
E. D. Skeene, representing the Scripps-McRae Association; and Richard
Little, representing the Chicago <i>Tribune</i>. Mr. Collins, the
Associated Press representative, wrote his people an account of this
whole episode, which was also given wide publicity. After describing
the committee&rsquo;s interview with the General down to a certain
point, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">But when General Otis came down to the frank admission
that it was his purpose to keep the knowledge of conditions here from
the public at home, and when the censor had repeatedly told us, in
ruling out plain statements of undisputed facts, &ldquo;My instructions
are to let nothing go that can hurt the Administration,&rdquo; we
concluded that protest was justifiable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Collins had written what he considered a conservative review of the
situation in June, saying reinforcements were needed. Of the
suppression of this he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The censor&rsquo;s comment (I made a note of it) was:
&ldquo;Of course we all know that we are in a terrible mess out here,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>but we don&rsquo;t want the people to get
excited about it. If you fellows will only keep quiet now we will pull
through <i>in time</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e5355src" href=
"#xd27e5355" name="xd27e5355src">45</a> without any fuss at
home!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Collins&rsquo;s letter proceeds: &ldquo;When I went to see him
[Otis] he repeated the same old story about the insurrection going to
pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As to the charge of suppressing the real condition of our sick in
the hospitals, Mr. Collins says that General Otis remarked that the
&ldquo;hospitals were full of perfectly well men who were shirking and
should be turned out.&rdquo; On June 2, 1899, according to General
Otis&rsquo;s report (p. 121), sixty per cent. of one of the State
volunteer regiments were in hospital sick or wounded and there were in
its ranks an average of but eight men to a company fit for duty. The
report of the regimental surgeon stating this was forwarded by General
Otis to Washington with the comment that there were few cases of
serious illness; that the then &ldquo;present station of these
troops&rdquo;&mdash;the place where the fighting was hottest, San
Fernando&mdash;&ldquo;is considered by the Filipinos as a health
resort,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;when orders to take passage to the
United States are issued, both the Montana and South Dakota troops will
recover <i>with astonishing rapidity</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5366src" href="#xd27e5366" name="xd27e5366src">46</a></p>
<p>This round robin of course produced a profound sensation in the
United States. It was just what the American public had long suspected
was the case. Shortly afterward Secretary of War Alger resigned. Coming
as it did on the heels of the scandal about &ldquo;embalmed beef&rdquo;
having been furnished to the army <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223"
href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>in Cuba, it made him too much
of a load for the Administration to carry. He was succeeded by Mr.
Root, an eminent member of the New York Bar, whose masterful mind soon

<p class="first">There can surely be little doubt in any quarter that
Mr. Root is, in intellectual endowment and equipment at least, one of
the greatest, if he is not <i>the</i> greatest, of living American
statesmen. Mankind will always yield due acclaim to men who, in great
emergencies, see the essentials of a given situation, and at once
proceed to get the thing done that ought to be done. Whether the war in
the Philippines was regrettable or not, it had become, by midsummer of
1899, supremely important, from any rational and patriotic standpoint,
to end it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Mr. Root had not been in office as Secretary of War very long before
fleets of troop-ships, carrying some twenty-five well-equipped
volunteer regiments,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5398src" href=
"#xd27e5398" name="xd27e5398src">1</a> were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>swarming out of New York harbor bound for Manila
by way of the Suez Canal, and out of the Golden Gate for the same
destination <i>via</i> Honolulu. Nor was there any confusion as in the
Cuban helter-skelter. Everything went as if by clockwork. Moreover,
along with the new and ample force, went a clear, masterly,
comprehensive plan of campaign, prepared, not by General Otis at
Manila, but in the War Department at Washington, by officers already
familiar with the islands.</p>
<p>It was the purpose of this government at last to demonstrate
conclusively to the Filipino people that the representative of the
United States at Manila was &ldquo;the boss of the show,&rdquo; and
that Aguinaldo was <i>not</i>&mdash;a demonstration then sorely needed
by the exigencies of American prestige. The purpose can readily be
appreciated, but to understand the plan of campaign, and the method of
its execution, somewhat of the geography of Luzon must now be
considered. Before we approach the shores of Luzon and the city of
Manila, however, let us consider from a distance, in a bird&rsquo;s-eye
view, as it were, the relation of Luzon to the rest of the archipelago,
so as to know, in a comprehensive way, what we are &ldquo;going out for
to see.&rdquo; We may as well pause at this point, long enough to learn
all we will ever need to know, for the purposes of the scope of this
narrative, concerning the general geography of the Philippine
archipelago, and the governmental problems it presents. (<i>See folding
map at end of volume.</i>)</p>
<p>It is a common saying that Paris is France. In the same sense Manila
<i>is</i> the Philippines. In fact, the latter expression is more
accurate than the former, for Manila, besides being the capital city of
the country, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span><i>and</i> its chief port, is a city of over
200,000 people, while no one of the two or three cities next to it in
rank in population had more than 20,000.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5425src" href="#xd27e5425" name="xd27e5425src">2</a> By parity of
reasoning it may be said that Luzon <i>was</i> the Philippines, so far
as the problem which confronted us when we went there was concerned,
relatively both to the original conception in 1898 of the struggle for
independence, its birth in 1899, its life, and its slow, lingering
obstinate death in 1900&ndash;1902, in which last year the insurrection
was finally correctly stated to be practically ended. To know just how
and why this was true, is necessary to a clear understanding of that
struggle, including not only its genesis and its exodus, but also its
gospels, its acts, its revelations, and the multitudinous subsequent
commentaries thereon.</p>
<p>The total land area of the Philippine archipelago, according to the
American Census of 1903, is 115,000 square miles.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5439src" href="#xd27e5439" name="xd27e5439src">3</a> The area of
Luzon, the principal island, on which Manila is situated, is 41,000
square miles, and that of Mindanao, the only other large island, is
36,000.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5445src" href="#xd27e5445" name=
"xd27e5445src">4</a> Between these two large islands, Luzon on the
north, and Mindanao on the south, there are a number of smaller ones,
but acquaintance with only six of these is essential to a clear
understanding of the American occupation. Many Americans, too busy to
have paid <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>much attention to the Philippine Islands, which
are, and must ever remain, a thing wholly apart from American life,
have a vague notion that there are several thousand of them. This is
true, in a way. American energy has made, for the first time in their
history, an actual count of them, &ldquo;including everything which at
high tide appeared as a separate island.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5452src" href="#xd27e5452" name="xd27e5452src">5</a> The work was
done for our Census of 1903 by Mr. George R. Putnam, now head of the
Lighthouse Board of the United States. Mr. Putnam, counted 3141 of
them.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5457src" href="#xd27e5457" name=
"xd27e5457src">6</a> Of these, of course, many&mdash;many hundred
perhaps&mdash;are merely rocks fit only for a resting place for birds.
2775, have an area of less than a square mile each, 262 have an area of
between 1 and 10 square miles, 73 between 10 and 100 square miles, and
20 between 100 and 1000 square miles. This accounts for, and may
dismiss at once from consideration 3130&mdash;all but 11. Most of these
3130 that are large enough to demand even so much as a single word here
are poorly adapted to human habitation, being in most instances,
without good harbors or other landing places, and usually covered
either with dense jungle or inhospitable mountains, or both. Their
total area is only about 8500 square miles, of the 115,500 square miles
of land in the archipelago. None of them have ever had any political
significance, either in Spain&rsquo;s time, or our own, and therefore,
the whole 3130 may at once be eliminated from consideration, leaving 11
only requiring any special notice at all&mdash;the 11 largest islands.
Of these, Luzon and Mindanao have already been mentioned. The remaining
9, with their respective areas and populations, are: <span class=

<p>The political or governmental problem being now reduced from 3141
islands to eleven, the last three of the nine contained in the above
table may also be eliminated as follows: (<i><a href="#map">See map at

<p>Paragua, the long narrow island seen at the extreme lower left of
any map of the archipelago, extending northeast southwest at an angle
of about 45&deg;, is practically worthless, being fit for nothing much
except a penal colony, for which purpose it is in fact now used.</p>
<p>Masbate&mdash;easily located on the map at a glance, because the
twelfth parallel of north latitude intersects the 124th meridian of
longitude east of Greenwich in its southeast corner&mdash;though noted
for cattle and other quadrupeds, is not essential to a clear
understanding of the human problem in its broader governmental
aspects.</p>

<p>Mindoro, the large island just south of the main bulk of Luzon,
pierced by the 121st meridian of longitude east of Greenwich, is thick
with densely wooded mountains and jungle over a large part of its area,
has a reputation of being very unhealthy (malarious), is also very
sparsely settled, and does not now, nor has it ever, cut any figure

<p>Eliminating Paragua, Masbate, and Mindoro as not essential to a
<span class="corr" id="xd27e5599" title=
"Source: substanially">substantially</span> correct general idea of the
strategic and governmental problems presented by the Philippine
Islands, we have left, besides Luzon and Mindanao, nothing but the
half-dozen islands which appear in large type in the above table:
Panay, Negros, Cebu, Bohol, Samar, Leyte, with a total area of 20,500
square miles. Add these to Luzon&rsquo;s 41,000 square miles and
Mindanao&rsquo;s 36,000, and you have the Philippine archipelago as we
are to consider it in this book, that is to say, two big islands with a
half dozen little ones in between, the eight having a total area of
97,500 square miles, of which the two big islands represent nearly
four-fifths.</p>
<p>While the great Mohammedan island of Mindanao, near Borneo, with its
36,000 square miles<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5604src" href=
"#xd27e5604" name="xd27e5604src">12</a> of area, requires that the
Philippine archipelago be described as stretching over more than 1000
miles from north to south, still, inasmuch as Mindanao only contains
about 500,000 people all told,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5610src"
href="#xd27e5610" name="xd27e5610src">13</a> half of them
semi-civilized,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5616src" href="#xd27e5616"

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>no more to do with the main problem of whether,
if ever, we are to grant independence to the 7,000,000 Christians of
the other islands, than the questions that have to be passed on by our
Commissioner of Indian Affairs have to do with the tariff.</p>
<p>Mindanao&rsquo;s 36,000 square miles constitute nearly a third of
the total area of the Philippine archipelago, and more than that
fraction of the 97,500 square miles of territory to a consideration of
which our attention is reduced by the process of elimination above
indicated. Turning over Mindanao to those crudely Mohammedan,
semi-civilized Moros would indeed be &ldquo;like granting
self-government to an Apache reservation under some local chief,&rdquo;
as Mr. Roosevelt, in the campaign of 1900, ignorantly declared it would
be to grant self-government to Luzon under Aguinaldo.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e5623src" href="#xd27e5623" name="xd27e5623src">15</a>
Furthermore, the Moros, so far as they can think, would prefer to owe
allegiance to, and be entitled to recognition as subjects of, some
great nation.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5629src" href="#xd27e5629"
name="xd27e5629src">16</a> Again, because, the Filipinos have no moral
right to control the Moros, and could not if they would, the latter
being fierce fighters and bitterly opposed to the thought of possible
ultimate domination by the Filipinos, the most uncompromising advocate
of the consent-of-the-governed principle has <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>not
a leg to stand on with regard to Mohammedan Mindanao. Hence I affirm
that as to it, we have a distinct and separate problem, which cannot be
solved in the lifetime of anybody now living. But it is a problem which
need not in the least delay the advent of independence for the other
fourteen-fifteenths of the inhabitants of the archipelago<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5634src" href="#xd27e5634" name=
"xd27e5634src">17</a>&mdash;all Christians living on islands north of
Mindanao. It is true that there are some Christian Filipinos on
Mindanao, but in policing the Moros, our government would of course
protect them from the Moros. If they did not like our government, they
could move to such parts of the island as we might permit to be
incorporated in an ultimate Philippine republic. Inasmuch as the
300,000 or so Moros of the Mohammedan island of Mindanao and the
adjacent islets called Jolo (the &ldquo;Sulu Archipelago,&rdquo; so
called, &ldquo;reigned over&rdquo; by the Sultan of comic opera fame)
originally presented, as they will always present, a distinct and
separate problem, and never did have anything more to do with the
Philippine insurrection against us than their cousins and
co-religionists over in nearby Borneo, the task which confronted Mr.
Root in the fall of 1899, to wit, the suppression of the Philippine
insurrection, meant, practically, the subjugation of one big island,
Luzon, containing half the population and one-third the total area of
the archipelago, and six neighboring smaller ones, the Visayan
Islands.</p>
<p>And now let us concentrate our attention upon Luzon as Mr. Root no
doubt did, with infinite pains, in the fall of 1899. Of the 7,600,000
people of the Philippines<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5639src" href=

<p>By all Americans in the Philippines since our occupation, the island
of Luzon is always contemplated as consisting of two parts, to wit,
northern Luzon, or that part north of Manila, and southern Luzon, the
part south of Manila. The great central plain of Luzon, lying just
north of Manila, is nearly as large as the republic of Salvador, or the
State of New Jersey, <i>i.e.</i>, in the neighborhood of 7000 square
miles area<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5683src" href="#xd27e5683" name=
"xd27e5683src">24</a>&mdash;and, like Salvador, it contains a
population of something over 1,000,000 inhabitants. The area and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=

are, according to the <i>Philippine Census of 1903</i>, as follows:</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, the central plain comprising the above five
provinces is bounded as follows: On the north by mountains and Lingayen
Gulf, on the east by a coast range of mountains separating it from the
Pacific Ocean, on the west by a similar range separating it from the
China Sea, and on the south by Manila Bay and mountains. The Rio Grande
de Pampanga flows obliquely across it in a southwesterly direction into
Manila Bay, and near its western edge runs the railroad from Manila to
Dagupan on Lingayen gulf. Dagupan is 120 miles from Manila. This plain,
held by a well-equipped insurgent army backed by the moral support of
the whole population, became the theatre of war as soon as the
volunteers of 1899 began to arrive at Manila, the insurgent capital
being then at Tarlac, a place about two-thirds of the way up the
railroad from Manila to Dagupan.</p>
<p>Of course the first essential thing to do was to break <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>the
backbone of the insurgent army, and scatter it, and the next thing to
do was to capture Aguinaldo, the head and front of the whole business,
the incarnation of the aspirations of the Filipino people. The
operations to this end commenced in October, and involved three
movements of three separate forces:</p>
<p>(1) A column under General Lawton, proceeding up the Rio Grande and
along the northeastern borders of the plain, and bending around
westward along its northern boundary toward the gulf of Lingayen,
garrisoning the towns en route, and occupying the mountain passes on
the northeast which give exit over the divide into the great valleys
beyond.</p>
<p>(2) An expedition under General Wheaton, some 2500 in all,
proceeding by transports to the gulf of Lingayen, the chief port of
which, Dagupan, was the northern terminus of the railroad; the
objective being to land on the shore of that gulf at the northwest
corner of the plain, occupy the great coast road which runs from that
point to the northern extremity of the island, and also to proceed
eastward and effect a junction with the Lawton column.</p>
<p>(3) A third column under General MacArthur, proceeding up the
railroad to the capture of Tarlac, the third insurgent capital, and
thence still up the railroad to its end at Dagupan, driving the
enemy&rsquo;s forces before it toward the line held by the first two
columns.</p>
<p>On October 12th, General Lawton moved up the Rio Grande from a place
called Aryat, a few miles up stream from where the railroad crosses the
river at Calumpit, driving the insurgents before him to the northward
and westward. His command was made up mainly from the 3d Cavalry and
the 22d Infantry, together with several hundred scouts, American and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>Maccabebee. On the 20th San Isidro was again
captured. That was the place Lawton had evacuated in May previous.
Arriving in the Islands with Colonel E. E. Hardin&rsquo;s regiment, the
29th U. S. Volunteer Infantry, on November 3, 1899, the writer was
immediately detailed to the Maccabebee scouts, to take the place of
Lieutenant Boutelle, of the regular artillery, a young West Pointer
from Oregon, who had been killed a day or two previous, and reported to
Major C. G. Starr, General Lawton&rsquo;s Adjutant-General in the field
(whom he had known at Santiago de Cuba the previous year) at San Isidro
on or about November 8th. Major Starr said: &ldquo;We took this town
last spring,&rdquo; stating how much our loss had been in so doing,
&ldquo;but, partly as a result of the Schurman Commission parleying
with the insurgents General Otis had us fall back. We have just had to
take it again.&rdquo; General Lawton garrisoned San Isidro this time
once for all, and pressed on north, capturing the successive towns en
route. Meantime, General Young&rsquo;s cavalry, and the Maccabebee
scouts under Major Batson, a lieutenant of the regular army, and a
medal-of-honor graduate of the Santiago campaign, were operating to the
west of the general line of advance, striking insurgent detachments
wherever found and driving them toward the line of the railroad. By
November 13th, Lawton&rsquo;s advance had turned to the westward,
according to the concerted plan of campaign above described,
garrisoning, as fast as they were taken, such of the towns of the
country over which he swept as there were troops to spare for. We knew
that Aguinaldo had been at Tarlac when the advance began, and every
officer and enlisted man of the command was on the <i>qui vive</i> to
catch him. By November 18th, General Lawton&rsquo;s forces held a line
of posts extending up the eastern <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236"
href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>side of the plain, and
curving around across the northern end to within a few miles of the
gulf of Lingayen.</p>
<p>On November 6th, General Wheaton set sail from Manila for Lingayen
Gulf, with 2500 men of the 13th Regular and 33d Volunteer Infantry, and
a platoon of the 6th Artillery, convoyed by the ships of the navy, and
next day the expedition was successfully landed at San Fabian,
&ldquo;with effective assistance from the naval convoy against spirited
resistance,&rdquo; says Secretary of War Root, in his annual report for
1899. The navy&rsquo;s assistance on that occasion was indeed
&ldquo;effective,&rdquo; but such passing mention hardly covers the
case. In the first place, they selected the landing point, their
patrols being already familiar with the coasts. As soon as the
transports were sighted, about eleven o&rsquo;clock on the morning of
November 7th, Commander Knox, the senior officer present, who commanded
the <i>Princeton</i>, and Commander Moore, of the <i>Helena</i>, went
out to meet and confer with General Wheaton. This done, the landing was
effected under protection of the navy&rsquo;s guns. Besides the naval
vessels above named, there were also present the <i>Bennington</i>
under Commander Arnold, the <i>Manila</i> under Lieutenant-Commander
Nazro, and two captured Spanish gun-boats small enough to get close in
shore, the <i>Callao</i>, and the <i>Samar</i>. The troops were
disembarked in two columns of small boats towed by launches.
Lieutenant-Commander Tappan in charge of the <i>Callao</i>, and Ensign
Mustin, commanding the <i>Samar</i>, were especially commended in the
despatches of Admiral Watson, commander-in-chief of the Asiatic
squadron. Both bombarded the insurgent trenches at close range during
the landing, and Mustin actually steamed in between the insurgents and
the head of the column of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href=
"#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>troop-boats, so as to intercept
and receive the brunt of their fire himself, and, selecting a point
about seventy-five yards from the enemy&rsquo;s trenches whence he
could effectually pepper them, ran his ship aground so she would stick,
and commenced rapid firing at point blank range, driving the enemy from
his trenches, and enabling Colonel Hare of the 33d, and those who
followed, to land without being subjected to further fire while on the
water.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5816src" href="#xd27e5816" name=
"xd27e5816src">27</a></p>
<p>On the 11th of November, Colonel Hare with the 33d Volunteer
Infantry and one Gatling gun under Captain Charles R. Howland of the
28th Volunteer Infantry, a lieutenant of the regular army, and a member
of General Wheaton&rsquo;s staff, proceeded southeastward to San
Jacinto, and attacked and routed some 1200 to 1600 intrenched
insurgents, Major John A. Logan being among our killed. The enemy left
eighty-one dead in the trenches, and suffered a total loss estimated at
three hundred. While space does not permit dwelling on the details of
engagements, it may be remarked here, once for all, that the 33d
Volunteer Infantry, Colonel Luther R. Hare commanding, made more
reputation than any other of the twenty-five regiments of the volunteer
army of 1899, except, possibly, Colonel J. Franklin Bell&rsquo;s
regiment, the 36th. This is no reflection on the rest. These two were
lucky enough to have more opportunities. In meeting his opportunities,
however, Colonel Hare, like Colonel Bell, proved himself a superb
soldier; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>his field-officers, especially Major
March,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5826src" href="#xd27e5826" name=
"xd27e5826src">28</a> were particularly indefatigable; and his men were
mostly Texans, accustomed to handling a rifle with effect. Space also
forbids following Captain Howland and his Gatling gun into the
engagement of November 11th, but from the uniformity with which General
Wheaton&rsquo;s official reports commend his young aide&rsquo;s bravery
and efficiency on numerous occasions in 1899&ndash;1900, it may be
safely assumed that those qualities were behind that Gatling gun at San
Jacinto. There was a vicious rumor started after the San Jacinto fight
and given wide circulation in the United States, that Major Logan was
shot in the back by his own men. I saw a major surgeon a few days later
who had been an eye-witness to his death. He said an insurgent
sharpshooter shot Major Logan from a tree, and that the said
sharpshooter was promptly thereafter dropped from his perch full of 33d
Infantry bullets. Says General Wheaton&rsquo;s despatch of November
12th: &ldquo;Major Logan fell while gallantly leading his
battalion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5829src" href="#xd27e5829"
name="xd27e5829src">29</a></p>
<p>On November 5th, General MacArthur, with a strong column, composed
mainly of the 9th, 17th, and 36th Regiments of Infantry, two troops of
the 4th Cavalry, two platoons of the 1st Artillery, and a detachment of
scouts, advanced up the railroad from Angeles, in execution of his part
of the programme.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5840src" href="#xd27e5840"
name="xd27e5840src">30</a> Angeles is some distance up the railroad
from Calumpit, where the railroad crosses the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>Rio
Grande.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5845src" href="#xd27e5845" name=
"xd27e5845src">31</a> General MacArthur&rsquo;s column encountered and
overwhelmed the enemy at every point, entering Tarlac on November 12th,
and effecting a junction with General Wheaton at Dagupan, the northern
terminus of the Manila-Dagupan Railroad, 120 miles from Manila, on
November 20th.</p>
<p>After General Lawton had finished his part of the round-up, he had a
final conference with General Young on November 18th at Pozorubio,
which is near the northeastern border of the plain, bade him good-bye,
and soon afterward went south to dispose of a body of insurgents who
were giving trouble near Manila. It was in this last expedition that he
lost his life at San Mateo about twelve miles out of Manila on December
19, 1899.</p>
<p>The first of the two purposes of the great Wheaton-Lawton-MacArthur
northern advance, viz., the dispersion of the insurgent army of
northern Luzon had been duly accomplished. The other purpose had failed
of realization. Aguinaldo had not been captured. He escaped through our
lines.</p>
<p>Such is in brief the story of the destruction of the Aguinaldo
government in 1899 by General Otis, or rather by Mr. Root. But the
trouble about it was that it would not stay destroyed. It &ldquo;played
possum&rdquo; for a while, the honorable President retiring to
permanent headquarters in the mountains &ldquo;with his government
concealed about his person,&rdquo; as Senator Lodge put it later in a
summary of the case for the Administration, before the Senate, in the
spring of 1900. If the distinguished and accomplished senator from
Massachusetts, in adding at that time to the gaiety of nations,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>had had access to a certain diary kept by one of
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s personal staff throughout that period, subsequently
submitted, in 1902, to the Senate Committee of that year, he could have
swelled the innocuous merriment with such cheery entries as &ldquo;Here
we tightened our belts and went to bed on the ground&rdquo;&mdash;the
time alluded to being midnight after a hard day&rsquo;s march without
food, the place, some chilly mountain top up which the &ldquo;Honorable
Presidente&rdquo; and party had that day been guided by the
ever-present and ever-willing <i>paisano</i> (fellow countryman) of the
immediate neighborhood&mdash;whatever the neighborhood&mdash;to
facilitate them in eluding General Young&rsquo;s hard riding cavalry
and scouts. The writer has no quarrel with Senator Lodge&rsquo;s
witticism above quoted, having derived on reading it, in full measure,
the suggestive amusement it was intended to afford. It is true that
about all then left of the &ldquo;Honorable Presidente&rsquo;s&rdquo;
government, for the nonce, was in fact concealed about his person. It
was of a nature easily portable. It needed neither bull trains, pack
ponies, nor coolies to carry it. It consisted solely of the loyal
support of the whole people, who looked to him as the incarnation of
their aspirations. Said General MacArthur to the Senate Committee in
1902 concerning Aguinaldo: &ldquo;He was the incarnation of the
feelings of the Filipinos.&rdquo; &ldquo;Senator Culberson: &lsquo;And
represented the Filipino people?&rsquo; General MacArthur: &lsquo;I
think so; yes&rsquo;.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5859src" href=

leisure to examine the ruins. To admit, in the same breath,
participation in that war and profound regret that it ever had
occurred, is not an incriminating <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241"
href="#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>admission. In this case as in
any other where you have done another a wrong, by thrashing him or
otherwise, under a mistake of fact, the first step toward righting the
wrong is to frankly acknowledge it. As soon as Aguinaldo&rsquo;s flight
and wanderings terminated in the finding of permanent headquarters, he
began sending messages to his various generals all over Luzon and the
other islands, and wherever those orders were not intercepted they were
delivered and loyally obeyed. This kept up until General Funston
captured him in 1901. One traitor among all those teeming millions
might have betrayed his whereabouts, but none appeared. The obstinate
character and long continuance of the warfare in northern Luzon after
the great round-up which terminated with the final junction of the
Lawton, Wheaton, and MacArthur columns near Dagupan, as elsewhere later
throughout the archipelago, was at first very surprising to our
generals. It had been supposed that to disperse the insurgent army
would end the insurrection. As events turned out, it only made the
resistance more effective. So long as the insurgents kept together in
large bodies they could not hide. And as they were poor marksmen, while
the men behind our guns, like most other young Americans, knew
something about shooting, the ratio of their casualties to ours was
about 16 to 1.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5866src" href="#xd27e5866"
name="xd27e5866src">33</a> When General MacArthur began his advance on
Tarlac, General Lawton his great march up the valley of the Rio Grande,
and General Wheaton his closing in from Dagupan, Aguinaldo with his
cabinet, generals, and headquarters troops abandoned Tarlac, their
capital, and went up the railroad to Bayambang. Here they held a
council of war, which General MacArthur <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb242" href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>describes in his
report for 1900 (from information obtained later on) as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">At a council of war held at Bayambang, Pangasinan,
about November 12, 1899, which was attended by General Aguinaldo and
many of the Filipino military leaders, a resolution was adopted to the
effect that the insurgent forces were incapable of further resistance
in the field, and as a consequence it was decided to disband the army,
the generals and the men to return to their own provinces, with a view
to organizing the people for general resistance by means of guerrilla
warfare.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5875src" href="#xd27e5875" name=
"xd27e5875src">34</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This had been the plan from the beginning, the council of war simply
determining that the time to put the plan into effect had arrived.
Accordingly, the uniformed insurgent battalions and regiments broke up
into small bands which maintained a most persistent guerrilla warfare
for years thereafter. During those years they seldom wore uniforms,
disappearing and hiding their guns when hotly pursued, and reappearing
as non-combatant peasants interrupted in agricultural pursuits, with
invariable protestations of friendship. Hence all such came to be known
as <i>amigos</i> (friends), and the word <i>amigo</i>, or friend,
became a bitter by-word, meaning to all American soldiers throughout
the archipelago an enemy falsely claiming to be a friend. <i>And every
Filipino was an &ldquo;amigo.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Still, the volunteers had arrived in time to enable Mr. Root to make
a very nice showing to Congress, and through it to the people, in his
annual report to the President for 1899, dated November 29th. This
report is full of cheerful chirps from General Otis to the effect that
the resistance was practically ended, and the substance of the
information it conveyed duly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href=
"#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>found its way into the
President&rsquo;s message of December of that year and through it to
the general public. One of the Otis despatches said: &ldquo;Claim to
government by insurgents can be made no longer.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5895src" href="#xd27e5895" name=
"xd27e5895src">35</a> This message went on to state that nothing was
now left but &ldquo;banditti,&rdquo; and that the people are all
friendly to our troops. Thus misled, Mr. Root repeated to the President
and through him to Congress and the country the following nonsense:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">It is gratifying to know that as our troops got away
from the immediate vicinity of Manila they found the natives of the
country exceedingly friendly *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. This was doubtless due in
some measure to the fact that the Pampangos, who inhabit the provinces
of Pampanga and Tarlac, and the Pangasinanes, who inhabit Pangasinan,
as well as the other more northerly tribes, are unfriendly to the
Tagalogs, and had simply submitted to the military domination of that
tribe, from which they were glad to be relieved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In characterizing this as nonsense no disrespect is intended to Mr.
Root. He did not know any better. He was relying on General Otis. But
it is sorely difficult to convey in written words what utter nonsense
those expressions about &ldquo;the Pampangos&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
Pangasinanes&rdquo; are to any one who was in that northern advance in
the fall of 1899. Imagine a British cabinet minister making a report to
Parliament in 1776 couched in the following words, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The Massachusetts-ites, who inhabit Massachusetts, and
the Virginia-ites who inhabit Virginia, as well as most of the other
inhabitants are unfriendly to the New York-ites, and have simply
submitted to the military domination of the last named,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and you have a faint idea of the accuracy of Mr. Root&rsquo;s
report. It is quite true that the Tagalos were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>the
prime movers in the insurrection against us, as they had been in all
previous insurrections against Spain. But the &ldquo;Tagalo
tribe&rdquo; was no more alone among the Filipino people in their
wishes and views than the &ldquo;unterrified&rdquo; Tammany tribe who
inhabit the wilds of Manhattan Island, at the mouth of the Hudson
River, are alone in their views among our people.</p>
<p>On page 70 of this report, Secretary Root reproduces a telegram from
General Otis dated November 18, 1899, stating that on the road from San
Nicolas to San Manuel, a day or so previous, General Lawton was
&ldquo;cordially received by the inhabitants.&rdquo; He announces in
the same telegram the drowning of Captain Luna, a volunteer officer
from New Mexico, who was one of General Lawton&rsquo;s aides, and had
been a captain in Colonel Roosevelt&rsquo;s regiment of Rough Riders
before Santiago. The writer happens to have been on that ride with
General Lawton from San Nicolas to San Manuel, and was within a dozen
feet of Captain Luna when the angry current of the Agno River caught
him and his pony in its grip and swept both out of sight forever, along
with divers troopers of the 4th Cavalry, horses and riders writhing to
their death in one awful, tangled, struggling mass. He can never forget
the magnificent dash back into the wide, ugly, swollen stream made by
Captain Edward L. King of General Lawton&rsquo;s staff, as he spurred
his horse in, followed by several troopers who had responded to his
call for mounted volunteers to accompany him in an effort to save the
lives of the men who went down. Their generous work proved futile. But
it was inspired partly by common dread of what they knew would happen
to any half-drowned soldier who might be washed ashore far away from
the column and captured. If an army was ever &ldquo;in enemy&rsquo;s
country&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>it was then and there. When we reached San
Manuel that night, Captains King and Sewall, the two surviving personal
aides of General Lawton&rsquo;s staff, and the writer, stopped, along
with the general, in a little <i>nipa</i> shack on the roadside.
General Lawton, was in an upper room busy with couriers and the like,
but downstairs King, Sewall, and myself set to work to
<i>buscar</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e5924src" href="#xd27e5924"
name="xd27e5924src">36</a> something to eat. I got hold of an
<i>hombre</i> (literally, a man; colloquially a native peasant man),
who went to work with apparent alacrity, and managed to provide three
ravenously hungry young men with a good meal of chicken, eggs, and
rice. After supper, being new in the country, the writer remarked to
the general on the alacrity of the <i>hombre</i>. I had brought out
from the United States the notions there current about the nature of
the resistance. General Lawton said, with a humorous twinkle in those
fine eyes of his: &ldquo;Humph! If you expected to be killed the next
minute if you didn&rsquo;t find a chicken, <i>you&rsquo;d</i> probably
find one too.&rdquo; It is true that in the course of the campaign
General Young sent a telegram to General Otis at Manila characterizing
his reception at the hands of the natives as friendly. This was
prompted by our column being met as it would come into a town by the
town band. It did not take long to see through this, and other like
hypocrisy entirely justifiable in war, though such tactics deceived us
for a little while at first into thinking the people were genuine
<i>amigos</i> (friends). General Otis, not being near the scene,
remained under our original brief illusion. Let us return, however,
from Mr. Root&rsquo;s &ldquo;patient and unconsenting millions
dominated by the Tagalo tribe,&rdquo; of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb246" href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>1899, to the facts,
and follow the course of events succeeding Lawton&rsquo;s junction with
Wheaton and MacArthur and his farewell to Young.</p>
<p>General Young, with his cavalry, and the Maccabebee scouts,
continued in pursuit of Aguinaldo through the passes of the mountains,
the latter having managed to run the gauntlet of our lines successfully
by a very close shave. How narrowly he escaped is illustrated by the
fact that after a fight we had at the Aringay River on November 19th,
in which Major Batson was wounded while gallantly directing the
crossing of the river, we remained that night in the town of Aringay,
and at the very time we were &ldquo;hustling for chow&rdquo; in
Aringay, Aguinaldo was in the village of Naguilian an hour or so
distant, as was authoritatively ascertained long afterward from a
captured diary of one of his staff officers.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e5944src" href="#xd27e5944" name="xd27e5944src">37</a></p>
<p>General Young proceeded up the coast road, in hot haste, taking one
town, San Fernando de Union, after a brief engagement led by the
general in person&mdash;imagine a brigadier-general leading a charge at
the head of thirty-seven men!&mdash;but Aguinaldo had turned off to the
right and taken to the mountains. General Lawton wired General Otis
about that time, in effect, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href=
"#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>in announcing Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
escape through our lines and his own tireless brigade-commander&rsquo;s
bold dash in pursuit of him with an inadequate force of cavalry
hampered by lack of horseshoes and nails for the same, &ldquo;If Young
does not catch Aguinaldo, he will at least make him very
unhappy.&rdquo; The Young column garrisoned the towns along the route
over which it went, occupying all the western part of Northern Luzon,
hereafter described, and also later on rescued Lieutenant Gilmore of
the navy, Mr. Albert Sonnichsen, previously an enlisted man and since a
writer of some note, and other American prisoners who had been in the
hands of the insurgents for many months. General Young finally made his
headquarters at Vigan, in the province of Ilocos Sur, a fine town in a
fine country. The Ilocanos are called &ldquo;the Yankees of the
Philippines,&rdquo; on account of their energy and industry. Vigan is
on the China sea coast of Luzon (the west coast), about one hundred
miles up the old Spanish coast road, or &ldquo;King&rsquo;s
Highway&rdquo; (Camino Real), from Lingayen Gulf (where the
hundred-and-twenty mile railroad from Manila to Dagupan ends) and about
eighty miles from the extreme northern end of the island of
Luzon.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5963src" href="#xd27e5963" name=
"xd27e5963src">38</a></p>
<p>As subsequent policies and their effect on one&rsquo;s attitude
toward a great historic panorama do not interfere in the least with a
proper appreciation of the bravery and efficiency of the army of
one&rsquo;s country, it is with much regret that this narrative cannot
properly chronicle in detail what the War Department reports record of
the stirring deeds of General Young, and the officers and men of his
command, Colonels Hare and Howze, Captains Chase and Dodd, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>and
the rest,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5970src" href="#xd27e5970" name=
"xd27e5970src">39</a> performed during the long course of the work now
under consideration. One incident, however, is appropriate in this
connection, not only to a collection of <i>genre</i> pictures of the
war itself, but also to a place among the lights and shadows of the
general picture of the American occupation. On December 2, 1899, Major
March of the 33d Infantry had his famous fight at Tila pass, in which
young Gregorio del Pilar, one of the ablest and bravest of the
insurgent generals, was killed. The locality mentioned is a wild pass
in the mountains of the west coast of Luzon, that overlook the China
Sea, some 4500 feet above sea level. It was strongly fortified, and was
believed by the insurgents to be impregnable. The trail winds up the
mountains in a sharp zigzag, and was commanded by stone barricades
loop-holed for infantry fire. The advance of our people was checked at
first by a heavy fire from these barricades. The approach being
precipitous, it looked for a while as if the position would indeed be
impregnable, and the idea of taking it by a frontal attack was
abandoned. But a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249"
name="pb249">249</a>]</span>hill to the left front of the barricade was
seized by some of our sharpshooters&mdash;those Texans of the 33d were
indeed <i>sharpshooters</i>&mdash;and after that, under cover of their
fire, our troops managed to get in a fire simultaneously both on the
flank and rear of the occupants of the barricades, climbing the
precipitous slope up the mountain side by means of twigs and the like,
and finally killing some fifty-two of the enemy, General Pilar among
the number. After the fight was over, Lieutenant Quinlan, heretofore
mentioned, moved by certain indignities in the nature of looting
perpetrated upon the remains of General Pilar, buried them with such
military honors as could be hastily provided, after first taking from a
pocket of the dead general&rsquo;s uniform a souvenir in the shape of
an unfinished poem written in Spanish by him the night before,
addressed to his sweetheart; and, the burial finished, the American
officer placed on the rude headstone left to mark the spot this
generous inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">General Gregorio Pilar, killed at the battle of Tila
Pass, December 2d, 1899, commanding Aguinaldo&rsquo;s rear-guard. <i>An
officer and a gentleman.</i> (Signed) D. P. Quinlan, 2d Lieutenant,
11th Cavalry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The brief incident over, Quinlan hurried on, rejoined the column,
and resumed the work of Benevolent Assimilation and the war against
Home Rule with all the dauntless ardor of his impetuous Irish nature.
Whatever the ultimate analysis of the ethics of this
scene&mdash;Quinlan at the grave of Pilar&mdash;clearly the Second
Lieutenant Quinlan of 1899 would hardly have agreed with the
vice-presidential candidate of 1900, Colonel Roosevelt, that granting
self-government to the Filipinos would be like granting self-government
to an Apache reservation under some local chief.</p>
<p>The territory occupied and finally &ldquo;pacified&rdquo; by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>General Young, with the effective assistance of
the officers heretofore mentioned, and many other good men and true,
was ultimately organized into a military district, which was called the
First District of the Department of Northern Luzon. As territory was
fought over, occupied, and finally reduced to submission, that
territory would be organized into a military district by the commanding
general or colonel of the invading column, under the direction of the
division commander. The military &ldquo;Division of the
Philippines,&rdquo; which was succeeded by the Civil Government of the
Philippines under Governor Taft in 1901, of course covered all the
territory ceded by the Treaty of Paris. It was divided into four
&ldquo;Departments,&rdquo; the Department of Northern Luzon, the
Department of Southern Luzon, the Department of the Visayas,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5998src" href="#xd27e5998" name=
"xd27e5998src">40</a> and the Department of Mindanao and Jolo. General
Young commanded the First District of the Department of Northern
Luzon&mdash;which included the three west coast provinces north of
Lingayen Gulf, and the three adjacent mountain provinces&mdash;from the
time he led his brigade into that region in pursuit of Aguinaldo until
shortly before Governor Taft&rsquo;s inauguration in the summer of
1901. Many were the combats, great and small, of General Young&rsquo;s
brigade, in compassing the task of crushing the resistance in that part
of Luzon into which he led the first American troops in the winter of
1899&ndash;1900. The resistance was obstinate, desperate, and long
drawn out, but when he finally reported the territory under his command
&ldquo;pacified,&rdquo; it <i>was</i> pacified. A soldier&rsquo;s task
had been performed in a soldierly manner. The work had been done
thoroughly. General <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251"
name="pb251">251</a>]</span>Young gave the Ilocano country a lesson it
never forgot, before politics had time to interfere. We have never had
any trouble in that region from that day to this.</p>
<p>Before the army of occupation had had time to do in southern Luzon
what General Young did in northern Luzon and thereby secure like
permanent results in that region, a &ldquo;peace-at-any-price&rdquo;
policy was inaugurated to meet the exigencies of Mr. McKinley&rsquo;s
campaign for the Presidency in 1900. Our last martyred President clung
all through that campaign to his original assumption that Benevolent
Assimilation would work, and that the single burning need of the hour
was to make clear to the Filipinos what our intentions were&mdash;as if
powder and lead did not spell denial of independence plain enough, as
if that were not the sole issue, and as if that issue had not been
submitted, with deadly finality, to the stern arbitrament of war.
However, neither Lord Roberts in India, nor Lord Kitchener in Egypt
ever more effectively convinced the people of those countries that his
flag must be respected as an emblem of sovereignty, than General Young
did the Ilocanos. Take the month of April, 1900 for instance. Several
days after the expiration of said month (on May 5th) General Otis was
relieved and went home. During the month of April, General Young killed
five hundred insurgents in his district.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6008src" href="#xd27e6008" name="xd27e6008src">41</a> But this
did not prevent General Otis, arriving as he did in the United States
in the month of June, when the national political conventions meet,
from &ldquo;repeating <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href=
"#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>the same old story about the
insurrection going to pieces&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6016src"
href="#xd27e6016" name="xd27e6016src">42</a>&mdash;<i>only</i>, not
&ldquo;going&rdquo; now, but &ldquo;gone.&rdquo; Nor did it, and like
sputterings of insurrection all over the place, prevent Judge
Taft&mdash;the &ldquo;Mark Tapley of this Philippine business&rdquo; as
he humorously told the Senate Committee of 1902 he had been
called&mdash;from cabling home, during the presidential campaign of
1900, a series of superlatively optimistic bulletins,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e6022src" href="#xd27e6022" name="xd27e6022src">43</a> based on
the testimony of Filipinos who had abandoned the cause of their country
as soon as patriotism meant personal peril, all such testimony being
eagerly accepted, as testimony of the kind one wants and needs badly
usually is, in total disregard of information directly to the contrary
furnished by General MacArthur and other distinguished soldiers who had
been then on the ground for two years.</p>
<p>The area and population of the territory occupied by General Young,
the &ldquo;First District of the Department of Northern Luzon,&rdquo;
was, according to the Census of 1903, as follows:</p>

<p>As this narrative purposes so to present the geography of the
Philippine Islands as to facilitate an easy remembrance of <i>the
essentials only</i> of the governmental problem there presented, we
will hereafter speak of the First District as containing, roughly, 6500
square miles, and 650,000 people. Whenever, if ever, a Philippine
republic is set up, these six provinces are very likely, for
geographical and other reasons, to become one of the original states
comprising that republic, just as the states of Mexico are made up of
groups of provinces.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6112src" href=
"#xd27e6112" name="xd27e6112src">47</a></p>
<p>The rest of the story of the northern campaign of 1899&ndash;1900
immediately following Aguinaldo&rsquo;s escape into the mountains
through General Young&rsquo;s and General Lawton&rsquo;s lines, being a
necessary part of the American occupation of the Philippines, may also
serve as a text for further acquainting the reader with the geography
of Luzon. War is the best possible teacher of geography, and it may be
well to communicate in broken doses, as we received them, the lessons
on the subject which the 8th Army Corps learned in 1899 and the
subsequent years so thoroughly that we could all pronounce with
astonishing glibness, the most unpronounceable names imaginable.</p>
<p>When the great Wheaton-Lawton-MacArthur &ldquo;Round-up&rdquo;
reached the mountains on the northeast of the great central plain, in
the latter part of November 1899, Captain Joseph B. Batchelor, with one
battalion of the 24th (negro) Infantry, and some scouts under
Lieutenant Castner, a very intrepid and tireless officer, boldly cut
loose from the column of which he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb254" href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>a part, and, pressing
on over the Caranglan pass, overran the province of Nueva Vizcaya,
which is part of the watershed of north central Luzon, proceeding from
Bayombong, the capital of Nueva Vizcaya, down the valley of the Magat
River, by the same route Messrs. Wilcox and Sargent of the navy had
made their pleasant junket in the fall of 1898 as described in <a href=
"#ch6">Chapter VI</a> (<i>ante</i>). Following this route Captain
Batchelor finally came into Isabela province, where the Magat empties
into the Cagayan River, reaching Iligan, the capital of Isabela, ninety
miles northeast of Bayombong, about December 8th. From Iligan Batchelor
went on, promptly overcoming all resistance offered, down the great
Cagayan valley, some 110 miles due north, to the sea at Aparri, the
northernmost town of Luzon and of the archipelago, where he met two
vessels of our navy, the <i>Newark</i> and the <i>Helena</i>, under
Captain McCalla, and found, to his inexpressible (but partially and
rather fervently expressed) chagrin, that the insurgents who had fled
before him, and also the garrison at Aparri, had already surrendered to
the navy. The territory thus covered by Batchelor&rsquo;s bold,
brilliant, and memorable march over two hundred miles of hostile
country from the mountains of central Luzon down the Cagayan valley to
the northern end of the island, at Aparri,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6135src" href="#xd27e6135" name="xd27e6135src">48</a> consisted
of the three provinces of Cagayan, Isabela, and Nueva Vizcaya. The area
and population of these three, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255"

<p>The troops of Captain Batchelor&rsquo;s command were later on
relieved by the 16th Infantry, commanded by Colonel Hood, under whom
the above group of three provinces finally became the &ldquo;Second
District of the Department of Northern Luzon.&rdquo; As part of the
plan to provide the reader with a fair general idea of Luzon
conveniently portable in memory, he is requested to note, at this
point, that hereinafter the Cagayan valley, with its three
provinces,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6200src" href="#xd27e6200" name=
"xd27e6200src">51</a> will be alluded to as a district containing
12,000 square miles and 300,000 people. As was remarked concerning the
original military district commanded by General Young, to wit, the
First District, so of Colonel Hood&rsquo;s district, the
Second&mdash;that is to say, as the Ilocano country may some day become
the state of Ilocos, so, for like geographical and other governmental
reasons, the three provinces of the Cagayan valley may some day become
the state of Cagayan in the possible Philippine republic of the future.

<p>Having now followed the &ldquo;far-flung battle line&rdquo; of the
volunteers of &rsquo;99 and their comrades in arms, the regulars, from
Manila northward across the rice paddies of central Luzon and over the
mountains to the northern extremity of the island, let us return to the
central plain, for reasons which will be stated in so doing. Between
the China Sea and the coast range which forms the western boundary of
the central plain of Luzon, there is a long strip of territory&mdash;a
west wing of the plain, as it were&mdash;about 125 miles long, with an
average width of not more than twenty miles, stretching from Manila Bay
to Lingayen Gulf. This is divided, for governmental purposes into two
provinces, Bataan on the south, whose southern extremity lay on Admiral
Dewey&rsquo;s port side as he entered Manila Bay the night before the
naval battle of May 1, 1898, and Zambales on the north. The area and
population of this territory are as follows:</p>

<p>Also, between the Pacific Ocean and the coast range which forms the
eastern boundary of the plain is a longer, narrower, and very sparsely
populated strip, or east wing, divided also into two provinces,
Principe on the north and Infanta on the south, each supposed to
contain about fifteen thousand people. Principe and Infanta are wholly
unimportant, except that, to avoid confusion, we must account for all
the provinces visible on the maps of Luzon. These two provinces
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>never gave any trouble and no one ever bothered
about them.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6252src" href="#xd27e6252" name=
"xd27e6252src">52</a> In the mountains of Zambales and Bataan, however,
as in most of the other provinces of the archipelago, the struggle was
long kept up, just as the Boers kept up their war for independence
against Great Britain about the same time, by guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>The central plain with five provinces has already been fully
described. If to this plain you add its two wings, above mentioned, you
have the nine provinces of central Luzon you see on the map. And if to
them you add the six provinces of the Ilocos country and the three of
the Cagayan valley, you have clearly before you the political make-up
of northern Luzon&mdash;eighteen provinces in all. When central Luzon
was arranged by districts under the military occupation, it was divided
into three parts, the Third, Fourth, and Fifth districts of the
Department of Northern Luzon, the Third District being under General
Jacob H. Smith of Samar fame,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6257src" href=
"#xd27e6257" name="xd27e6257src">53</a> the Fourth under General
Funston, and the Fifth under General Grant. The Sixth and last district
of northern Luzon was made up of the city of Manila and adjacent
territory. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=

<p>It will be seen from the foregoing that the Third District was
nearly equal in area to the Fourth and Fifth added together, and that
the same was true as to its population figure.</p>
<p>Just as the six provinces of the Ilocano country, first occupied by
General Young and organized as &ldquo;The First District of the
Department of Northern Luzon,&rdquo; should some day evolve into a
State of Ilocos, and the three provinces of the Cagayan valley,
occupied by Colonel Hood as the Second District, into an ultimate State
of Cagayan, so the provinces of General Smith&rsquo;s old district, the
Third, should finally become a State of Pangasinan.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e6422src" href="#xd27e6422" name="xd27e6422src">55</a> This
Third District may be conveniently recollected as accounting for,
roughly speaking, 4500 square miles of territory and 625,000 people.
The total combined area of General Funston&rsquo;s old district, the
Fourth,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6425src" href="#xd27e6425" name=

its total population 650,000. No reason is apparent why these two
districts, the Fourth and Fifth, should not ultimately evolve into a
State of Pampanga. The five original military districts,<a class=

<p>It may surprise the reader after all the blood and thunder to which
his attention has hereinabove been subjected, apropos of northern Luzon
and the winter of 1899&ndash;1900, to know that the insurgents were
still bearding the lion in his den, <i>i. e.</i>, General Otis in
Manila, by operating in very considerable force in the village-dotted
country within cannon-shot of the road from Manila to Cavite in
January, 1900. Nevertheless such was the case.</p>
<p>On the 4th of January, 1900, General J. C. Bates was assigned to the
command of the First Division of the Eighth Army Corps, General
Lawton&rsquo;s old division, and an active campaign was commenced in
southern Luzon. The plan adopted was that General Wheaton with a strong
force should engage and hold the enemy in the neighborhood of Cavite,
while General Schwan, starting at the western horn of the half moon to
which the great lake called Laguna de Bay has already been likened,
should move rapidly down the west shore of the lake, and around its
south shore to Santa Cruz near its eastern end, or horn, garrisoning
the towns en route, as taken, instead of leaving them to be re-occupied
by the insurgents. Santa Cruz is the same place where General Lawton
had &ldquo;touched second base,&rdquo; as it were, with a flying column
in April, 1899.</p>
<p>This plan was duly carried out. The Schwan column started from San
Pedro Macati, the initial rendezvous, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb261" href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>a few miles out of
Manila, on January 4, 1900, now garrisoning the towns en route, instead
of leaving them to be fought over and captured again as heretofore. The
first stiff fight we had in that campaign was at Bi&ntilde;an, on
January 6, 1900, one of the places General Lawton&rsquo;s expedition
had taken when he fought his way over the same country the year before.
O. K. Davis and John T. McCutcheon, who were in that fight and
campaign&mdash;in fact one of them had the ice-cold nerve to photograph
the Bi&ntilde;an fight while it was going on, as I learned when we all
went down to the creek near the town, after we took it, to freshen
up&mdash;can testify that we did not then hear any nonsense about a
&ldquo;Tagal&rdquo; insurrection, such as Secretary of War Root&rsquo;s
<i>Report for 1899</i>, published shortly before, is full of, and that
on the contrary the whole country was as much a unit against us and as
loyal to the Aguinaldo government as northern Luzon had been. And
inasmuch as I am doing some &ldquo;testifying&rdquo; along here myself,
and assuming to brush aside without the slightest hesitation, as wholly
erroneous, information conveyed to the American public at the time in
the state papers of President McKinley and Secretary of War Root, it is
only due the reader, whose attention is being seriously asked, that
&ldquo;the witness&rdquo; should &ldquo;qualify&rdquo; as to the
opportunities he may have had, if any, to know whereof he speaks,
concerning the character of the opposition. To that end, the following
document, which General Schwan was kind enough to send me afterwards,
is submitted as sent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">EXTRACT COPY.</p>
<p>Headquarters Detachment Macabebe Scouts.<br>
The Adjutant General, Schwan&rsquo;s Expeditionary Brigade:</p>
<p>Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report of the

<p>The Detachment, consisting of five (5) officers and one hundred and
forty (140) men, was divided into two companies, commanded by 1st Lt.
J. Lee Hall, 33rd Inf., and 1st Lt. Blount, 29th Inf., left San Pedro
Macati the afternoon of Jan. 4th, 1900 *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>I wish to invite your attention, especially, to the good work done

<p>Very Respectfully,<br>
<span class="sc">Wm. C. Geiger</span>, 1st Lt. 14th Inf.,

January and February, 1900.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Theo. Schwan</span>,<br>

</blockquote>
<p>The activities of Generals Bates and Wheaton, and the Schwan
Expedition of January-February, 1900, extended the American occupation,
so far as there were troops enough immediately available to go around,
over the lake-shore portions and the principal towns of the two great
provinces of southern Luzon bordering on the Laguna de Bay, viz.,
Cavite and Laguna; and over parts of the two adjacent provinces of
Batangas and Tayabas.</p>
<p>Batangas bounds Cavite on the south, and is itself bounded on the
south by the sea, where a fairly good port offered a fine gateway for
smuggling arms into the interior from abroad. Tayabas province adjoins
Laguna on the southeast. Cavite province has always been, since the
opening of the Suez Canal, about 1869, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>and the agitations
for political reform in Spain which culminated in the Spanish republic
of 1873, quickened the thought of Spain&rsquo;s East Indies, the home
of insurrection, the breeding place of political agitation. Aguinaldo
himself was born within its limits in 1869. Laguna province comprehends
most of the country lying between the southern and eastern lake-shore
of the Laguna de Bay and the mountains which skirt that body of water
in the blue distance, all parts of it being thus in easy and safe touch
by water transportation by night with Cavite, the home and headquarters
of insurgency.</p>
<p>Just as northern Luzon had been gradually organized into military
districts as conquered, so was southern Luzon. The territory, over-run,
as above described, by Generals Bates, Wheaton, and Schwan, was divided
into two districts.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6549src" href=
"#xd27e6549" name="xd27e6549src">58</a> Colonel Hare commanded the
First District, Cavite province and vicinity. General Hall commanded
the Second District, Batangas, Laguna, and Tayabas. The area and
population of these four provinces, according to the Census of 1903,
were as follows:</p>

<p>For convenience of subsequent allusion, this group of provinces may
be treated as representing roughly 8500 square miles of territory and
700,000 people. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264"
name="pb264">264</a>]</span>These four provinces group themselves
together naturally from a military standpoint. As physical force is the
final basis of all government, these four provinces constitute a
logical administrative governmental unit, as shown by the action of our
military authorities in their extension of the American occupation. It
would seem therefore that if there should ever be a Philippine
republic, they would probably constitute one of its states&mdash;the
State, let us say, of Cavite.</p>
<p>The rest of southern Luzon below that part above described consists
of a peninsula which, owing to its odd formation, is easy to remember.
The mainland of Luzon, that is to-say, that part of the island which
our narrative has already covered, remotely suggests, in shape, the
State of Illinois. At least it resembles Illinois more than it does any
other State of our Union, in that its length runs north and south, and
its average length and width are nearer that of Illinois than any
other. At the southeast corner of this mainland, the observer of the
map will see, jutting off to the southeast from the mainland, the
peninsula in question. It is about a hundred and fifty miles long, with
an average width of possibly thirty miles&mdash;a minimum width of,
say, ten miles, and a maximum of fifty,&mdash;and is separated from
Samar by the narrow, swift, and treacherous San Bernardino Strait,
which connects the Pacific Ocean with the China Sea. This peninsula is
frequently called &ldquo;the Hemp Peninsula.&rdquo; The importance of
controlling the hemp ports prompted General Otis to send General Bates
with an expedition to those ports on February 15, 1900.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e6613src" href="#xd27e6613" name=
"xd27e6613src">59</a> This expedition did little more than occupy those
ports. The great interior continued under insurgent control some time
afterward. The report of the Secretary of War, Mr. Root, for 1900, goes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>on to describe an engagement, or two, sustained
by the Bates Expedition shortly after it landed, and concludes, with a
complacency almost Otis-like, by stating that shortly thereafter
&ldquo;the normal conditions of industry and trade relations with
Manila were resumed by the inhabitants.&rdquo; Of course Mr. Root
believed this, and so did Mr. McKinley. More the pity, as we shall
later see. General Otis was now getting anxious to go home, and
hastened to &ldquo;occupy&rdquo; and organize the rest of the
archipelago, on paper, at least, the hemp peninsula becoming, on March
20, 1900, the Third District of the Department of Southern Luzon,
Brigadier-General James M. Bell commanding. The provinces comprised in
this district, with their areas and populations as given by the Census
of 1903, were as follows:</p>

<p>For convenience of subsequent allusion, these three provinces of the
hemp peninsula which constituted the Third Military District of the
Military Department of Southern Luzon in 1900, may be regarded as
comprising, roughly, 6000 square miles of territory and 600,000 people.
If the Philippine republic of the future which is the dream of the
Filipino people, prove other than an idle dream, the hemp peninsula
will probably some day constitute a state of that republic, an
appropriate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=

of Camarines.</p>
<p>The Fourth District of southern Luzon&mdash;there were but
four&mdash;was occupied by the 29th U. S. Volunteer Infantry, commanded
by Colonel E. E. Hardin, one of the best executive officers General
Otis had in his whole command. The Fourth District comprised a lot of
islands unnecessary to be considered at length in this bird&rsquo;s-eye
view of the panorama, but necessary to be mentioned in outlining the
military occupation. The 29th, like the other twenty-four volunteer
regiments, settled down with equanimity to the business of policing a
hostile country, sang with zest, like the rest of the twenty-five
volunteer regiments, that old familiar song, &ldquo;Damn, Damn, Damn
the Filipino,&rdquo; etc., and waited with the uniquely admirable
stoicism of the American soldier for the season of their home-going to
roll round, which, under the Act of Congress,<a class="noteref" id=

the spring of the following year.</p>
<p>In volume i., part 5, <i>War Department Report</i>, 1899, at pages 5
<i>et seq.</i>, may be found a journal illustrating the nature of the
&ldquo;police&rdquo; work done by the volunteers of 1899, in 1900, and
at pages 5 <i>et seq.</i> of the same report for 1900 (volume i., part
4) may be found a similar diary carried up to June 30, 1901. Throughout
the period covered by those reports, scarcely a day passed without what
the military folk coolly call &ldquo;contacts&rdquo; with the
enemy.</p>
<p>The Visayan Islands were in course of time duly organized, as Luzon
had previously been, departmentally and by military districts. The
Visayan Islands became the Department of Visayas, divided into
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>districts commanded either by regimental
commanders having a regiment or more with them, or by general officers.
For a long time no attempt to make military occupation effective in
these various islands, save in the coast towns, was attempted. However,
the indicated disposition of troops completed, technically at least,
the American occupation of the Visayan Islands.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the plan followed, as we have hitherto followed the army
in our narrative, first throughout northern Luzon and later through
southern Luzon, some data are now in order concerning the Visayan
Islands.</p>
<p>As already made clear, there are but six of the Visayan Islands with
which any one interested in the Philippines merely as a student of
world politics or of history need bother. The area and population of
these are as follows:<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6701src" href=

<p>Whenever, if ever, an independent republic is established in the
Philippines, the six islands above mentioned could and should
constitute self-governing commonwealths similar to the several States
of the American Union. The rest of the islands lying between Luzon and
Mindanao could easily be disposed of governmentally by being attached
to the <span class="corr" id="xd27e6774" title=
"Source: jursidiction">jurisdiction</span> of one of the said six
islands. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mindanao and the adjacent islets called Jolo were organized as the
Department of Mindanao and Jolo, under General Kobbe, with the 31st
Volunteer Infantry, Colonel Pettit&rsquo;s regiment, the 40th Volunteer
Infantry, Colonel Godwin&rsquo;s regiment, and the 23rd Regular
Infantry. Thus the archipelago was completely accounted for, for the
time being, just as all the territory of the United States was long
accounted for by our military authorities at home, with the Department
of the East, headquarters Governor&rsquo;s Island, New York; the
Department of the Lakes, headquarters Chicago; the Department of the
Gulf, headquarters Atlanta, etc. In this state of the case, General
Otis re-embraced his early pet delusion&mdash;if it was a delusion,
which charity and the probabilities suggest it should be
called&mdash;about the insurrection having gone to pieces; and decided
to come home. Possibly, also, he was homesick. General Otis was a very
positive character, a strong man. But even strong men get homesick
after long exile. When you hear the call of the homeland after long
residence &ldquo;east of Suez,&rdquo; you must answer the call, duty
not forbidding. General Otis had stood by his ink wells and the
Administration with unswerving devotion for twenty months, and was
entitled to come back home and tell the public all about the fighting
in the Philippines, and how entirely over it was, and how wholly right
Mr. McKinley was in his theory that the visible opposition to our rule
and the seeming desire to be free and independent did not represent the
wishes of the Filipino people at all, but only the &ldquo;sinister
ambitions of a few unscrupulous Tagalo leaders.&rdquo; Accordingly on
May 5, 1900, he was relieved at his own request, and departed for the
United States. He was succeeded in command by a very different type of
man, Major-General Arthur <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href=
"#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>MacArthur, upon whom now devolved
the problem of holding down the situation and of actually getting it
stably &ldquo;well in hand&rdquo; by June 30, 1901, the date of
expiration of the term of enlistment of the twenty-five volunteer
regiments organized under the Act of March 2, 1899. <span class=

States. Under the Act of March 2, 1899, providing the volunteer army of
35,000 men for the Philippines, twenty-four regiments of infantry and
one of cavalry were organized. The infantry regiments were numbered
Twenty-six to Forty-nine, both inclusive, the numbering taking up where
the numbering of the regular infantry regiments then ended, with the
Twenty-fifth. The cavalry regiment was called the Eleventh Cavalry, the
regular cavalry regimental enumeration ending at that time with the
Tenth. The Eleventh Cavalry and the Thirty-sixth Infantry were
organized, officered, and largely recruited from men of the State

fight that one of the narrowest escapes from death in battle ever
officially authenticated occurred. Lieutenant Dennis P. Quinlan, now a
captain of the 5th U. S. Cavalry, was struck just over the heart by an
insurgent bullet (probably more or less spent) while crossing the river
in the face of a hot fire, the bullet being deflected by a plug of
tobacco carried in the breast pocket of the regulation campaign blue
shirt he was wearing, which pocket, any one acquainted with that shirt
will remember, is at the left breast just over the heart (<i>War
Department Report</i>, 1900, vol. i., pt. 6, <span class="corr" id=

over, but soon recovered and went on. The flesh of the left breast over
the heart was bruised black and blue. He was recommended for a medal of
honor on account of the incident (<i>War Department Report</i>, 1900,

instance, there was what used to be known to the 8th Corps as
&ldquo;Col. Jim Parker&rsquo;s night attack at Vigan,&rdquo; which
occurred early in December, 1899, soon after that place was occupied,
the insurgents coming into the town in large numbers, at night under
command of General Ti&ntilde;io, through a tunnel so it was said, and
being driven out only after desperate close quarters&rsquo; fighting
from about two o&rsquo;clock in the morning until after broad daylight,
leaving the streets and plaza of Vigan much cumbered with their dead.
Again, later on, there was the sudden order, swiftly executed, in
obedience to which Lieutenant Grayson V. Heidt with a part of a troop
of the 3d Cavalry, rode from Laoag to Batac to the rescue of a besieged
garrison at the latter place, arriving in time to prevent a small
Custer massacre, the garrison having gotten short of ammunition, and
having just managed to telegraph for reinforcements a few moments
before the enemy cut the telegraph wire. Then, there was Lieutenant
Hannay, of the 22d Infantry, who being at the front, received an order
from General Lawton to come back to build a bridge. The order made him
sick, the surgeon reported him sick, the messenger returned with that
message, and then Hannay promptly got well, and stayed at the front.

<p class="first">Some one has said, &ldquo;Let me write the songs of a
people and I care not who makes their laws.&rdquo; Give me the campaign
songs of a war, and I will so write the history of that war that he who
runs may read, and, reading, <i>know</i> the truth. The volunteers of
1899 had, most of them, been in the Spanish War of &rsquo;98. That
struggle had been so brief that, to borrow a phrase of the principal
beneficiary of it, Colonel Roosevelt, there had not been &ldquo;war
enough to go &rsquo;round.&rdquo; The Philippine insurrection had
already broken out when the Spanish War volunteers returned from Cuba
in the first half of 1899. Few of them knew exactly where the
Philippines were on the map. They simply knew that we had bought the
islands, that disturbances of public order were in progress there, and
that the Government desired to suppress them. The President had called
for volunteers. That was enough. When they reached the islands, instead
of finding a lot of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271"
name="pb271">271</a>]</span>outlaws, brigands, etc., such as that
pestiferous, ill-conditioned outfit of horse-thieves and cane-field
burning patriots we volunteers of &rsquo;98 had to comb out of the
eastern end of Cuba under General Wood in the winter of 1898&ndash;9,
they found Manila, on their arrival, practically almost a besieged
city. They knew that the erroneous impression they had brought with
them was the result of misrepresentation. Who was responsible for that
misrepresentation they did not attempt to analyze. They simply set to
work with American energy to put down the insurrection. Nobody
questioned the unanimity of the opposition. There it was, a
<i>fact</i>&mdash;denied at home, but a fact. In the course of the
fight against the organized insurgent army they lost a great many of
their comrades, and in that way the unanimity of the resistance was
quite forcibly impressed upon them. By kindred psychologic processes
equally free from mystery, their determination to overcome the
resistance early became very set&mdash;a state of mind which boded no
good to the Filipinos. The army song given at the beginning of <a href=
"#ch11">Chapter XI</a> (<i>ante</i>), in which General Otis is made to
sing, after the fashion of some of the characters in <i>Pinafore</i>,
that pensive query to himself</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Am I the boss, or am I a tool?</p>
</div>
<p class="first">the first stanza of which closes</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Now I&rsquo;d like to know who&rsquo;s the boss of the
show,</p>
<p class="line">Is it me or Emilio Aguinaldo?</p>
</div>
<p class="first">was a point of departure, in the matter of
information, which served to acquaint them with all that had gone
before. They resented the loss of prestige to American arms and desired
to restore that prestige. While engaged in so doing, they became aware,
during the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>Presidential year 1900, that the campaign of
that year in the United States was based largely upon the pretence that
the majority of the Filipinos welcomed our rule. Naturally, their
experience led them to a very general and very cordial detestation of
this pretence. For one thing, it was an unfair belittling of the actual
military service they were rendering. People hate a lie whether they
are able to trace its devious windings to its source or sources, or to
analyze all its causes, or calculate all its possible effects, or not.
The real rock-bottom falsehood, not as fully understood then as it
became later, consisted in the impression sought to be produced at
home, in order to get votes, that the great body of the Filipino people
were not really in sympathy with their country&rsquo;s struggle for
freedom, and would be really glad tamely to accept the alien domination
so benevolently offered by a superior people, but were being coerced
into fighting through intimidation by a few selfish leaders acting for
their own selfish ends. While our fighting generals in the
field,&mdash;General MacArthur, for instance, whose interview with a
newspaper man just after the fall of Malolos, in March, 1899,
subsequently verified by him before the Senate Committee of 1902, has
already been noticed&mdash;at first believed that it was only a faction
that we had to contend with, they soon discovered that the whole people
were loyal to Aguinaldo and the cause he represented. But, while the
point as to how unanimous the resistance was remained a disputed matter
for some little time among those of our people who did not have to
&ldquo;go up against it,&rdquo; the most curious fact of that whole
historic situation, to my mind, is the absolute identity of the
disputed suggestion with that which had previously been used in like
cases in all ages by the powerful against people struggling to be free,
and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>cotemporaneous absence of any notation of the
coincidence by any conspicuous spectator of the drama, to say nothing
of us smaller fry who bore the brunt of the war or any portion of
it.</p>
<p>Those men of &rsquo;99 in the Philippines realized in 1900, vaguely
it may be, but actually, that they were waging a war of conquest after
the manner of the British as sung by Kipling, but under the
hypocritical pretence that they were doing missionary work to improve
the Filipino. They did not know whether the Filipinos could or could
not run a decent government if permitted. It was too early to form any
judgment. And even then there was no unanimous feeling that they could
not. Brigadier-General Charles King, the famous novelist, who was in
the fighting out there during the first half of 1899, was quoted in the
<i>Catholic Citizen</i>, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in June, 1899, as
having said in an interview given at Milwaukee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">There is no reason in the world why the people should
not have the self-government which they so passionately desire, so far
as their ability to carry it on goes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The real reason why the war was being waged was stated with the
honesty which heated public discussion always brings forth, by Hon.
Charles Denby, a member of the Schurman Commission of 1899, in an
article which appeared in the <i>Forum</i> for February, 1899, entitled
&ldquo;Why the Treaty Should be Ratified:&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6858src" href="#xd27e6858" name="xd27e6858src">3</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The cold, hard, practical question alone remains:
&ldquo;Will the possession of the islands benefit us as a
nation?&rdquo; If it will not, set them free to-morrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in the same magazine, the <i>Forum</i>, for June, 1900, in other
words to the very same audience, in an article <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>whose title is a protest, &ldquo;Do we Owe the
Filipinos Independence?&rdquo; we find this same distinguished diplomat
sagaciously deferring to that not inconsiderable element of the
American public which is opposed to wars for conquest, with the rank
hypocrisy which must ever characterize a republic warring for gain
against the ideals that made it great, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">A little time ought to be conceded to the
Administration to ascertain what the wish of the people [meaning the
people of the Philippine Islands] really is;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6878src" href="#xd27e6878" name="xd27e6878src">4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>adding some of the stale but ever-welcome salve originally invented
by General Otis for use by Mr. McKinley on the public conscience of
America, about the war having been &ldquo;fomented by professional
politicians,&rdquo; and not having the moral support of the whole
people. &ldquo;A majority of the Filipinos are friendly to us,&rdquo;
he says. Even as early as January 4, 1900, in the New York
<i>Independent</i>, we find Mr. Denby abandoning all his previous
honesty of 1899 about &ldquo;the cold, hard, practical question,&rdquo;
and rubbing his hands with invisible soap to the tune of the following
hypocrisy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Let us find out how many of the people want
independence, and how many are willing to remain loyal to our
government. It is believed a large majority [etc.].<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e6893src" href="#xd27e6893" name="xd27e6893src">5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same article even assumed an air of injured innocence and urged
that as soon as the insurgent army laid down its arms<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e6898src" href="#xd27e6898" name="xd27e6898src">6</a>
&ldquo;the intentions of our government <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>will be made known by
Congress.&rdquo; That was just thirteen years ago, and &ldquo;the
intentions of our government&rdquo; have never yet been &ldquo;made
known by Congress,&rdquo; despite the fact that the omission has all
these years been like a buzzing insect, lighting intermittently on the
sores of race prejudice and political difference in the Philippines, to
say nothing of the circumstance that such omission leaves everybody
guessing, including ourselves. The omission has been due to the fact
that both the McKinley Administration which committed the original
blunder of taking the islands, and the succeeding Administrations which
have been the legatees of that blunder, have always needed in their
Philippine business the support both of those whose votes are caught by
the Denby honesty of 1899 and those whose votes are caught by the Denby
hypocrisy of 1900.</p>
<p>War is a great silencer of hypocrisy. In the presence of real sorrow
and genuine anger, it slinks away and is seen no more until more piping
times. The lists of casualties had been duly bulletined to the United
States from time to time between February, 1899, and June, 1900, so
that by the date last named it had become &ldquo;good politics&rdquo;
to throw off the mask. Hence, at the Republican National Convention
held in Philadelphia June 19&ndash;21, 1900, we find that astute
past-master of the science of government by parties, Senator Lodge,
boldly throwing off the mask thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We make no hypocritical pretense of being interested
in the Philippines solely on account of others. We believe in trade
expansion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now the words of a United States Senator are much listened to by an
army in the field. When a war breaks out, it is usually your Senator
who gets your commission <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href=
"#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>for you originally, and has you
promoted and made captain, colonel, or general, as the case may be, if
you do anything to deserve it, or lifted from the ranks to a
commission, if you do anything to deserve it, or sees that something
fitting is done if you die in any specially decent way. An army in the
field thinks a United States Senator is about one of the biggest
institutions going&mdash;which, seriously, is not far from the truth,
with all due respect to the blas&eacute; pessimists of the press
gallery. Consider then how wholly uninspiring, as a sentiment to die by
and kill by, the above senatorial utterance was to the men in the field
in the Philippines, who did not even then believe the islands would
pay. The &ldquo;cold, hard, practical&rdquo; fact was, if the Senator
was to be believed, that we were fighting for what is generically
called &ldquo;Wall Street;&rdquo; that it was primarily a Wall Street
war: an expedition fitted out to kill enough Filipinos to make the
survivors good future customers&mdash;&ldquo;Ultimate
Consumers&rdquo;&mdash;and only incidentally a war to make people
follow your way of being happy in lieu of their own. Yet we had most of
us, but shortly previously to that, gone trooping headlong to Cuba, in
the wake of the most inspiring single personality of this
age&mdash;Senator Lodge&rsquo;s friend, Colonel Roosevelt&mdash;some of
our American thoraxes inflated with sentiments thus nobly expressed by
the same distinguished Senator in his speech on the resolution which
declared war against Spain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are there&rdquo; (meaning in the then Cuban situation),
Senator Lodge had said in the Senate, in the matchless outburst of
eloquence with which he set the keynote to the war with
Spain&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We are there because we represent the spirit of
liberty and the new time. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* We have grasped no
man&rsquo;s territory, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href=
"#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>we have taken no man&rsquo;s
property, we have invaded no man&rsquo;s rights. <i>We do not ask their
lands.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e6922src" href="#xd27e6922" name=
"xd27e6922src">7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What difference, however, did it make to men under military orders,
and that far away from home, where American public opinion could not
and never can affect any given situation in time to help it, whether
they were serving God or the devil? Everything disappeared but the
primal fighting instinct. So the slaughter proceeded right merrily, at
a ratio of about sixteen to one, and many a Filipino died with the word
&ldquo;Independence&rdquo; on his lips,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e6929src" href="#xd27e6929" name="xd27e6929src">8</a> while many
an obscure American life went out, fighting under the Denby-Lodge
dollar-mark flag of pseudo-trade expansion. Can you imagine a more
thankless job? Do you wonder at the song that heads the chapter? Still,
war is war, once you are in it. All through 1900 the volunteers of 1899
kept on, cheerfully doing their country&rsquo;s work, not in the least
hampered by whys or wherefores, so far as the quality of their work
went. They knew that the Filipinos were not heathen, and they were not
perfectly clear that they themselves were doing the Lord&rsquo;s work,
unless &ldquo;putting the fear of God into the heart of the <i lang=
"es">insurrecto</i>&rdquo;&mdash;one of their campaign
expressions&mdash;was the Lord&rsquo;s work. However, if any of them
gave any special thought to the ethics of the situation, this did not
in the least affect their efficiency in action, nor their determination
to lick the Filipino into submission. When the brief organized
resistance of the insurgent armies in the field (February to November,
1899) underwent its transition to the far more formidable guerrilla
tactics, they realized that they were &ldquo;up <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>against&rdquo; a long and tedious task, in which
would be no special glamour, as there had been in Cuba, because the war
was not much more popular at home than it was with them. The rank net
hypocrisy of the whole situation, as they viewed it, is expressed in
the song which heads this chapter. It is an answer to the Taft nonsense
of 1900 about &ldquo;the people long for peace and are willing to
accept government under United States.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

"xd27e6946src">10</a> This statement of Judge Taft&rsquo;s, as well as
other like statements of his which followed it during the presidential
campaign of 1900, would have been perfectly harmless in home politics.
It was made in the same spirit of optimism in which a Taft man will
tell you to-day, &ldquo;The people are willing to see the Taft
Administration endorsed.&rdquo; But at that time in the Philippines
there was no possible way to prove or disprove the statement to the
satisfaction of anybody at home&mdash;or elsewhere, for that matter.
And, under the circumstances, it was at once a libel on Filipino
patriotism and an ungracious belittling of the work of the American
army. It was a libel on Filipino patriotism because it denied the loyal
(even if ill-advised) unanimity of the Filipino people in their
struggle for independence, and was a statement made recklessly, without
knowledge, in aid of a presidential candidate in the United States.
That it was highly inaccurate was well known to some <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>70,000 American soldiers then in the field, who
were daily getting <i>insurrecto</i> lead pumped into them, and also
well known to their gallant commander, General MacArthur, who told
Judge Taft just that thing. That it was an ungracious belittling of the
work of the army is certainly obvious enough, and it was so considered
by the army, and its commanding general aforesaid, who practically told
Judge Taft just that thing. But Mr. Root, then Secretary of War, was as
much interested in Mr. McKinley&rsquo;s re-election as Judge Taft was.
So he spread the Taft cablegrams broadcast throughout the United States
during the presidential campaign, and pigeonholed the MacArthur
messages and reports on the situation in the dusty and innocuous
desuetude of the War Department archives. Four years later at the
Republican National Convention of 1904, Mr. Root told the naked truth,
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">When the last national convention met, over 70,000
soldiers from more than 500 stations held a still vigorous enemy in
check.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6958src" href="#xd27e6958" name=
"xd27e6958src">11</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The foregoing is all a record made and unalterable. It is a fair
sample of the initial stages of one more of the experiments in
colonization by a republic which are scattered through history and
teach but one lesson. All the gentlemen concerned were personally men
of high type. But look at the net result of their work. The impression
it produced in the United States, at a tremendously critical period in
the country&rsquo;s history, when the men at the helm of state were
bending every energy to railroad the republic into a career of overseas
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>conquest, and using the army for that purpose,
can be called by a short and ugly word. The splendor of Mr.
Root&rsquo;s intellect is positively alluring, but he is a dangerous
man to republican institutions. Mr. Taft&rsquo;s part in that
conspiracy for the suppression of the facts of the Philippine situation
in 1900 was really due to kindliness of heart, regret at the war, and
earnest hope that it would soon end. Mr. Denby&rsquo;s part was that of
the out-and-out imperialist who has frank doubts in his own mind as to
whether it is axiomatic, after all, that the form of government
bequeathed us by our fathers is the best form of government yet
devised. But the conspiracy was really a sin against the progress of
the world, because it deceived the American people as to the
genuineness and unanimity of the desire of the Filipino people to
imitate the example set by us in 1776, which has since served as a
beacon-light of hope to so many people in so many lands in their
several struggles to be free.</p>
<p>By the spring of 1900, when General MacArthur relieved General Otis,
the volunteers of 1899 had gotten thoroughly warmed up to the work of
showing the Filipinos who was in fact &ldquo;the boss of the
show,&rdquo; and by June, 1900, when Judge Taft arrived, they had
gotten still warmer<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6969src" href=
"#xd27e6969" name="xd27e6969src">12</a>; and in General Otis&rsquo;s
successor they had a commander who understood his men thoroughly, and
was determined to carry out honestly, with firmness, and without
playing, as his predecessor had done, the r&ocirc;le of political
henchman, the purpose for which the army he commanded had been sent to
the Islands to accomplish. In this state of the case, the Taft
Commission came out.</p>
<p>This would seem rather an odd point at which to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>terminate a chapter on &ldquo;MacArthur and the
War,&rdquo; seeing that General MacArthur continued to command the
American forces in the Philippines and to direct their strenuous field
operations until July, 1901, more than a year later, when he was
relieved by General Chaffee, on whom thereafter devolved the subsequent
conduct of the war. But we must follow the inexorable thread of
chronological order, and so yield the centre of the stage from June,
1900, on, to Mr. Taft, else the resultant net confusion of ideas about
the American occupation of the Philippines might remain as great as
that which this narrative is an attempt in some degree to correct.</p>
<p>All through the official correspondence of 1899 and 1900 between the
Adjutant-General of the Army, General Corbin, and General Otis at
Manila, one sees Mr. McKinley&rsquo;s sensitiveness to public opinion.
&ldquo;In view of the impatience of the people&rdquo; you will do thus
and so, is a typical sample of this feature of that
correspondence.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e6978src" href="#xd27e6978"
name="xd27e6978src">13</a> Troubled, possibly, with misgivings, as to
whether, after all, in view of the vigorous and undeniably obstinate
struggle for independence the Filipinos were putting up, it would not
have been wiser to have done with them as we had done in the case of
Cuba, and troubled, beyond the peradventure of a doubt, about the
effect of the possible Philippine situation on the fortunes of his
party and himself in the approaching campaign for the presidency, Mr.
McKinley sent Mr. Taft out, in the spring preceding the election of
1900, to help General MacArthur run the war. We must now, therefore,
turn our attention to Mr. Taft, not forgetting General MacArthur in so
doing. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The essentials of the situation which confronted the
Taft Commission on its arrival in the islands in June, 1900, and the
mental attitude in which they approached that situation, may now be
briefly summarized, with entire confidence that such summary will
commend itself as fairly accurate to the impartial judgment both of the
historian of the future and of any candid contemporary mind.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to &ldquo;vex the dull ear&rdquo; of a mighty
people much engrossed with their own affairs, by repetition of any
further details concerning the original <i>de facto</i> alliance
between Admiral Dewey and Aguinaldo. Suffice it to remind a people
whose saving grace is a love of fair play, that, after the battle of
Manila Bay, when Admiral Dewey brought Aguinaldo down from Hong Kong to
Cavite, both the Admiral and his Filipino allies were keenly cognizant
of the national purpose set forth in the declaration of war against
Spain, and that the Filipinos could not have been expected to make any
substantial distinction between the casual remarks of a victorious
admiral on the quarter-deck of his flagship in May, remarks concurrent
and consistent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>with actual treatment of the Filipinos as
allies, and the imperious commands of a general ashore in December
thereafter, acting under specific orders pursuant to the Treaty of
Paris. The one great fact of the situation, &ldquo;as huge as high
Olympus,&rdquo; they <i>did</i> grasp, <i>viz.</i>, that both were
representatives of America on the ground at the time of their
respective utterances, and that one in December in effect repudiated
without a word of explanation what the other had done from May to
August. They had helped us to take the city of Manila in August, and,
to use the current phrase of the passing hour, coined in this period of
awakening of the national conscience to a proper attitude toward
double-dealing in general, they felt that they had been &ldquo;given
the double cross.&rdquo; In other words they believed that the American
Government had been guilty of a duplicity rankly Machiavellian. And
that was the cause of the war.</p>
<p>We have seen in the chapters on &ldquo;The Benevolent Assimilation
Proclamation&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Iloilo Fiasco&rdquo; that, in the
Philippines at any rate, no matter how mellifluously pacific it may
have sounded at home&mdash;no matter how soothing to the troubled
doubts of the national conscience&mdash;the Benevolent Assimilation
Proclamation of December 21, 1898, was recognized both by the Eighth
Army Corps and by Aguinaldo&rsquo;s people as a call to arms&mdash;a
signal to the former to get ready for the work of &ldquo;civilizing
with a Krag&rdquo;; a signal to the latter to gird up their loins for
the fight to the death for government of their people, by their people,
for their people; and that the yearning benevolence of said
proclamation was calculated strikingly to remind the Filipinos of
Spain&rsquo;s previous traditional yearnings for the welfare of Cuba,
indignantly cut short by us&mdash;yearnings &ldquo;to spare the great
island from the danger of premature <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>independence&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7019src" href="#xd27e7019" name="xd27e7019src">1</a> which that
decadent monarchy could not even help repeating in the swan-song
wherein she sued to President McKinley for peace. We did not realize
the absoluteness of the analogy then. It is all clear enough now. We
can now understand how and why Mr. McKinley&rsquo;s programme of
Annexation and Benevolent Assimilation of 1898&ndash;9, blindly earnest
as was his belief that it would make the Filipino people at once
cheerfully forego the &ldquo;legitimate aspirations&rdquo; to which we
ourselves had originally given a momentum so generous that nothing but
bullets could then possibly have stopped it, was in fact received by
them in a manner compared with which Canada&rsquo;s response in 1911 to
Speaker Champ Clark&rsquo;s equally benevolent suggestion of United
States willingness to accord to Canada <i>also</i>, gradual Benevolent
Assimilation and Ultimate Annexation, was one great sisterly sob of
sheer joy as at the finding of a long lost brother. From the arrival of
the American troops on June 30, 1898, until the outbreak of February 4,
1899, there had been two armies camped not far from each other, one
born of the idea of independence and bent upon it, the other at first
groping in the dark without instructions, and finally instructed to
deny independence. There was never any faltering or evasion on the part
of Aguinaldo and his people. They knew what they wanted and said so on
all occasions. At all times and in all places they made it clear, by
proclamation, by letter, by conversation, and otherwise, that
independence was the one thing to which, whether they were fit for it
or not, they had pledged &ldquo;their lives, their fortunes, and their
sacred honor.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285"
name="pb285">285</a>]</span></p>
<p>We have seen how easily the war itself could have been averted by
the Bacon Resolution of January, 1899, or some similar resolution
frankly declaring the purpose of our government; how here was Senator
Bacon at this end of the line pleading with his colleagues to be frank,
and to make a declaration in keeping with &ldquo;the high
purpose&rdquo; for which we had gone to war with Spain, instead of
holding on to the Philippines on the idea that they might prove a
second Klondike, while justifying such retention by arbitrarily
assuming, without any knowledge whatever on the subject, that the
Filipinos were incapable of self-government; how, there, at the other
end of the line, at Manila, Aguinaldo&rsquo;s Commissioners, familiar
with our Constitution and the history and traditions of our government,
were making, substantially, though in more diplomatic language,
precisely the same plea, and imploring General Otis&rsquo;s
Commissioners to give them some assurance which would quiet the
apprehensions of their people, and calm the fear that the original
assurance, &ldquo;We are going to lick the Spaniards and set you
free,&rdquo; was now about to be ignored because the islands might be
profitable to the United States.</p>
<p>We have seen the war itself, as far as it had progressed by June,
1900, one of the bitterest wars in history, punctuated by frequent
barbarities avenged in kind, and how, if the Taft Commission had not
come out with McKinley spectacles on, they would have seen the picture
of a bleeding, prostrate, and deeply hostile people, still bent on
fighting to the last ditch, not only animated by a feeling against
annexation by us similar to that the Canadians would have to-day if we
should also try the Benevolent Assimilation game on them&mdash;first
with proclamations breathing benevolence and then with cannon belching
grape-shot&mdash;but further <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href=
"#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>animated by the instinctive as
well as inherited knowledge common to all colored peoples, whether red,
yellow brown, or black, that wheresoever white men and colored live in
the same country together, <i>there the white man will rule</i>.
Understand, this was before Judge Taft had had a chance to assure them,
with the kindly Taft smile and the hearty Taft hand-shake, that their
benevolent new masters were going to reverse the verdict of the ages,
and treat them with a fraternal love wholly free from race prejudice.
If Judge Taft could only have arrived in January, 1899, and told them
that the Bacon Resolution really represented the spirit of the attitude
of the American people toward them, then the finely commanding bearing
of Mr. Taft, and the noble genuineness of his desire to see peace on
earth and goodwill toward men, might even have prevented the war. But
this is merely what <i>might</i> have been. What actually <i>was</i>,
when he <i>did</i> arrive, in June, 1900, was that the milk of human
kindness had long since been spilled, and his task was to gather it up
and put it back in the pail. When I, a Southern man who have taken part
in the only two wars this nation has had in my lifetime, reflect that
in this year of grace, 1912, Mr. Underwood&rsquo;s otherwise matchless
availability as the candidate of his party for President is questioned
on the idea that it might be a tactical blunder, because of &ldquo;the
late war,&rdquo; which broke out before either Mr. Underwood or myself
were born, I cannot share the Taft optimism as to the rapidity with
which the scars of &ldquo;the late war&rdquo; in the Philippines will
heal, and as to the affectionate gratitude toward the United States
with which the McKinley-Taft programme of Benevolent Assimilation will
presently be regarded by the people of the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>We have seen the futile efforts of the Schurman <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>Commission of 1899, sent out that spring, in
deference to American public opinion, with definite instructions to try
and patch up a peace, by talking to the leading spirits of a war for
independence, <i>now in full swing</i>, about the desirability of
benevolent leading-strings. &ldquo;They [meaning the Schurman
Commission] had come,&rdquo; says Mr. McKinley, in his annual message
to Congress of December 5, 1899,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7054src"
href="#xd27e7054" name="xd27e7054src">2</a> &ldquo;with the hope of
co-operating with Admiral Dewey and General Otis in establishing peace
and order.&rdquo; They came, they saw, they went, recognizing the
futility of the errand on which they had been sent. And now came the
Taft Commission a year later, on precisely the same errand, after the
Filipinos had sunk all their original petty differences and jealousies
in a very reasonable instinctive common fear of economic exploitation,
and a very unreasonable but, to them, very real common fear of race
elimination, amounting to terror, and been welded into absolute
oneness&mdash;if that were somewhat lacking before&mdash;in the fierce
crucible of sixteen months of bloody fighting against a foreign foe for
the independence of their common country. President McKinley&rsquo;s
message to Congress of December, 1899, is full of the old insufferable
drivel, so grossly, though unwittingly, ungenerous to our army then in
the field in the Philippines, about the triviality of the resistance we
were &ldquo;up against.&rdquo; The message in one place blandly speaks
of &ldquo;the peaceable and loyal majority who ask nothing better than
to accept our authority,&rdquo; in another of &ldquo;the sinister
ambitions of a few selfish Filipinos.&rdquo; Thus was outlined, in the
message announcing the purpose to send out the Taft Commission, the
view that no real fundamental resistance existed in the islands. Basing
contemplated action on this sort of stuff, the presidential
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>message outlines the presidential purpose as
follows&mdash;this in December, 1899, mind you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">There is no reason why steps should not be taken from
time to time to inaugurate governments <i>essentially popular in their
form</i> as fast as territory is held and controlled by our troops.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then follows the genesis of the idea which resulted in the Taft
Commission:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">To this end I am considering the advisability of the
return [to the islands] of the commission [the Schurman Commission] or
such of the members thereof as can be secured.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Cuba, General Wood began the work of reconstruction at Havana
with a central government and the best men he could get hold of, and
acted through them, letting his plans and purposes percolate
<i>downward</i> to the masses of the people. Not so in the Philippines.
Reconstruction there was to begin by establishing municipal
governments, to be later followed by provincial governments, and
finally by a central one; in other words, by placing the waters of
self-government at the bottom of the social fabric among the most
ignorant people, and letting them percolate <i>up</i>, according to
some mysterious law of gravitation apparently deemed applicable to
political physics. Of course, these poor people simply always took
their cue from their leaders, knowing nothing themselves that could
affect the success of this project except that we were their enemies
and that they might get knocked in the head if they did not play the
game. &ldquo;I have believed,&rdquo; says Mr. McKinley, in his message
to Congress of December, 1899, &ldquo;that reconstruction should not
begin by the establishment of one central civil government for all the
islands, with its seat at Manila, but rather <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>that
the work should be commenced by <i>building up from the
bottom</i>.&rdquo; Whereat, the young giant America bowed, in puzzled
hope, and worldly-wise old Europe smiled, in silent but amused
contempt.</p>
<p>If at the time he formulated this scheme for their government Mr.
McKinley had known anything about the Philippines, or the Filipinos, he
would have known that what he so suavely called &ldquo;building from
the bottom&rdquo; was like trying to make water run up hill,
<i>i.e.</i>, like starting out to have ideas percolate upward, so that
through &ldquo;the masses&rdquo; the more intelligent people might be
redeemed. The &ldquo;nigger in the woodpile&rdquo; lay in the words
&ldquo;essentially popular in form.&rdquo; Of course no government by
us &ldquo;essentially popular&rdquo; was possible at the time. But a
government &ldquo;popular in form&rdquo; would sound well to the
American people, and, if they could be kept quiet until after the
presidential election of 1900, maybe the supposed misunderstanding on
the part of the Filipinos of the benevolence of our intentions might be
corrected by kindness. Accordingly, the following spring,
cotemporaneously with General Otis&rsquo;s final departure from Manila
to the United States, in which free country he might say the war was
over as much as he pleased without being molested with round-robins by
Bob Collins, O. K. Davis, John McCutcheon, and the rest of those banes
of his insular career, who so pestiferously insisted that the American
public ought to know the facts, the Taft Commission was sent out, to
&ldquo;aid&rdquo; General MacArthur, as the Schurman Commission had
&ldquo;aided&rdquo; General Otis.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7094src"
href="#xd27e7094" name="xd27e7094src">3</a></p>
<p>It would seem fairly beyond any reasonable doubt <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>that
the official information the Taft Commission were given by President
McKinley concerning the state of public order they would find in the
islands on arrival was in keeping with the information solemnly
imparted to Congress by him in December thereafter, which was as
follows: &ldquo;By the spring of this year (1900) the effective
opposition of <i>the dissatisfied Tagals</i>&rdquo;&mdash;always the
same minimization of the task of the army as a sop to the American
conscience&mdash;&ldquo;was virtually ended.&rdquo; Then follows a
glowing picture of how the Filipinos are going to love us after we
rescue them from the hated Tagal, but with this circumspect
reservation: &ldquo;He would be rash who, with the teachings of
contemporary history, would fix a limit&rdquo; as to how long it will
take to produce such a state of affairs. Looking at that mighty
panorama of events from the dispassionate standpoint now possible, it
seems to me that Mr. McKinley&rsquo;s whole Philippine policy of
1899&ndash;1900 was animated by the belief that the more the Philippine
situation should resemble the really identical Cuban one in the
estimation of the American people, the more likely his Philippine
policy was to be repudiated at the polls in the fall of 1900. The Taft
Commission left Washington for Manila in the spring of 1900, after
their final conference with the President who had appointed them and
was a candidate for re-election in the coming fall, as completely
committed as circumstances can commit any man or set of men to the
programme of occupation which was to follow the subjugation of the
inhabitants, and to the proposition of present incapacity for
self-government, its corner-stone; to say nothing of the embarrassment
felt at Washington by reason of having stumbled into a bloody war with
people whom we honestly wanted to help, had never seen, and had nothing
but the kindliest feelings for. While the serene <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>and
capacious intellect of William H. Taft was still pursuing the even
tenor of its way in the halls of justice (as United States Circuit
Judge for the 8th Circuit), the Philippine programme was formulated at
Washington. Judge Taft went to Manila to make the best of a situation
which he had not created, to write the lines of the <i>Deus ex
machina</i> for a Tragedy of Errors up to that point composed wholly by
others. It has been frequently stated and generally believed that when
Mr. McKinley sent for him and proposed the Philippine mission, Judge
Taft replied, substantially: &ldquo;Mr. President, I am not the man for
the place. <i>I don&rsquo;t want the Philippines</i>.&rdquo; To which
Mr. McKinley is supposed to have replied: &ldquo;You <i>are</i> the man
for the place, Judge. I had rather <i>have</i> a man out there who
doesn&rsquo;t want them.&rdquo; The point of the original story lay in
what Mr. McKinley said. The point of the repetition of it here lies in
what Mr. Taft said, the inference therefrom being that he did not think
the true interests of his country &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; them, and that
had he been called into President McKinley&rsquo;s council sooner he
would have so advised; an inference warranted by his subsequent
admission that &ldquo;we blundered into colonization.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e7122src" href="#xd27e7122" name=
"xd27e7122src">4</a></p>
<p>It is utterly fatal to clear thinking on this great subject, which
concerns the liberties of a whole people, to treat Judge Taft&rsquo;s
reports as Commissioner to, and later Governor of, the Philippines as
in the nature of a judicial decision on the capacity of the Filipinos
for self-government. When he consented to go out there, he went, not to
review the findings of the Paris Peace Commission, but at the urgent
solicitation of an Administration <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292"
href="#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>whose fortunes were
irrevocably committed to those findings, including the express finding
that they were unfit for self-government, and the implied one that we
must remain to improve the condition of the inhabitants. He was thus
not a judge come out to decide on the fitness of the people for
self-government, but an advocate to make the best possible case for
their unfitness, and its corollary, the necessity to remain
indefinitely, just as England has remained in Egypt. The war itself
convinced the whole army of the United States that Aguinaldo would have
been the &ldquo;Boss of the Show&rdquo; had Dewey sailed away from
Manila after sinking the Spanish fleet. The war satisfied us all that
Aguinaldo would have been a small edition of Porfirio Diaz, and that
the Filipino republic-that-might-have-been would have been, very
decidedly, &ldquo;a going concern,&rdquo; although Aguinaldo probably
would have been able to say with a degree of accuracy, as Diaz might
have said in Mexico for so many years, &ldquo;The Republic? <i>I</i> am
the Republic.&rdquo; The war demonstrated to the army, to a Q. E. D.,
that the Filipinos are &ldquo;capable of self-government,&rdquo; unless
the kind which happens to suit the genius of the American people is the
only kind of government on earth that is respectable, and the one
panacea for all the ills of government among men without regard to
their temperament or historical antecedents. The educated patriotic
Filipinos can control the masses of the people in their several
districts as completely as a captain ever controlled a
company.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7135src" href="#xd27e7135" name=
"xd27e7135src">5</a> While the municipal officials of the McKinley-Taft
municipal kindergarten were stumbling along with the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>strange new town government system imported from
America, and atoning to their benignant masters for mistakes by writing
them letters about how benignant they&mdash;the teachers&mdash;were,
they&mdash;the pupils,&mdash;according to the contemporaneous
description by the commanding general of the United States forces in
the islands, were running a superbly efficient municipal system
throughout the whole archipelago, &ldquo;simultaneously and in the same
sphere as the American governments, and in many instances through the
same personnel,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7143src" href=
"#xd27e7143" name="xd27e7143src">6</a> in aid of the insurrection.
General MacArthur humorously adds that the town officials &ldquo;acted
openly in behalf of the Americans and secretly in behalf of the
insurgents, and, <i>with considerable apparent solicitude for the
interest of both</i>.&rdquo; In short, the war at once demonstrated
their &ldquo;capacity for self-government&rdquo; and made granting it
to them for the time being unthinkable. For the war was fought not on
the issue of the <i>capacity</i>, but on the issue of the
<i>granting</i>. The Treaty of Paris settled the &ldquo;capacity&rdquo;
part. The army in 1898, 1899, and 1900 can hardly be said to have had
any much more decided opinion on the <i>capacity</i> branch of the
subject, than Perry did about the Japanese in 1854. The Paris Peace
Commission having solemnly decided the &ldquo;capacity part&rdquo;
adversely to the Filipinos and the war having followed, thereafter Mr.
Taft went out to make out the best case possible in support of the
action of the Peace Commission and, <i lang="la">ex vi termini</i>, in
support of everything made necessary by the fact of the purchase.
Unless some one goes out to present to the American people the other
side of the case, they will never arrive at a just verdict.</p>
<p>Committed, <i>a priori</i>, to the task of squaring the McKinley
Administration with its course as to Cuba, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>the
only course possible for the Taft Commission was to set up a benevolent
government based upon the incompetency of the governed, which, being a
standing affront to the intelligence of the people, earns their hatred,
however it may crave their love. By the very bitterness of the
opposition it permits yet disregards, it binds itself ever more
irrevocably to remain a benevolent engenderer of malevolence.
Government and governed thus get wider apart as the years go by, and,
the <i lang="fr">raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of the former being the
mental deficiencies of the latter, it must, in self-defence, assert
those deficiencies the more offensively, the more vehemently they are
denied. What hope therefore can there be that the light that shone upon
Saul on the road to Damascus will ever break upon the President? What
hope that he will ever re-attune his ears to the voice of the
Declaration of Independence, calling down from where the Signers (we
hope without untoward exception) have gone, crying: &ldquo;William,
William, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against
the right of a people to pursue happiness in <i>their own
way</i>&rdquo;? The difference between the President and the writer is
that both went out to scoff and the latter remained&mdash;much
longer&mdash;to pray.</p>
<p>The Taft Commission arrived at Manila on June 3, 1900, loaded to the
guards with kindly belief in the stale falsehood wherewith General
Otis, ably assisted by his press censor, had been systematically
soothing Mr. McKinley&rsquo;s and the general American conscience
during the whole twenty months he had commanded the Eighth Army
Corps,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7179src" href="#xd27e7179" name=
"xd27e7179src">7</a> viz., that the insurrection was due solely to
&ldquo;the sinister ambitions of a few selfish leaders,&rdquo; and did
<i>not</i> represent the wishes of the whole people. It is true that
the insurrection originally started under <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s
auspices and under the initial protection of his puissant guns was
headed by a group of men most of whom, including Aguinaldo, were
Tagalos. But all Filipinos look alike, the whole seven or eight
millions of them. They differ from one another not one whit more than
one Japanese differs from another. And they all feel alike on most
things,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7187src" href="#xd27e7187" name=
"xd27e7187src">8</a> because they all have the same customs, tastes,
and habits of thought. Said Governor Taft to the Senate Committee in
1902:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">While it is true that there are a number of Christian
&ldquo;tribes,&rdquo; so-called,&mdash;I do not know the number,
possibly eight or ten, or twelve,&mdash;that speak different languages,
there is a homogeneity in the people in appearance, in habits, and in
many avenues of thought. To begin with, <i>they are
Catholics</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7196src" href=
"#xd27e7196" name="xd27e7196src">9</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly this should forever crucify the stale slander, still
ignorantly repeated in the United States at intervals, which seeks to
make the American people think the great body of the Filipino people
are still in a tribal state, ethnologically.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7205src" href="#xd27e7205" name="xd27e7205src">10</a> A Tagalo
leader is about as much a &ldquo;tribal&rdquo; leader as is a Tammany
&ldquo;brave&rdquo; of Irish antecedents. In fact there is much in
common between the two. Both are clannish. Both have a genius for
organization that is simply superb. Both are irrepressible about Home
Rule. Countless generations ago the Filipinos were lifted by the
Spanish priests out of the tribal state, and the educated people all
speak Spanish. But the original tribal dialects, which the Spanish
priests patiently mastered and finally reduced for them to a written
language, still survive in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href=
"#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>the several localities of their
origin. So that every Filipino of a well-to-do family is brought up
speaking two languages, Spanish, and the local dialect of his native
place, which is the only language known to the poorer natives of the
same neighborhood. Surely even the valor of ignorance can see that we
are presumptuously seeking to reverse the order of God and nature in
assuming that an alien race can lead a people out of the wilderness
better than could a government by the leading men of their own race to
whom the less favored look with an ardent pride that would be a
guarantee of loyal and inspiring co-operation. You can beat a balking
horse to death but you <i>cannot</i> make him wag his tail, or
otherwise indicate contentment or a disposition to cordial co-operation
which will make for progress. Mr. Bryan has visited the Philippines,
and his evidence is simply cumulative of mine, as mine, based on six
years&rsquo; acquaintance with the Filipinos, is simply cumulative of
Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s testimony of 1898, so often cited hereinbefore,
and of the opinion of Hon. George Curry, a Republican member of
Congress from New Mexico who served eight years in the Philippines, and
believes they can safely be given their independence by 1921. Mr. Bryan
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">So far as their own internal affairs are concerned,
they do not need to be subject to any alien government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He further says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">There is a wide difference, it is true, between the
general intelligence of the educated Filipino and the laborer on the
street and in the field, but this is not a barrier to self-government.
Intelligence controls in every government, except where it is
suppressed by military force. Nine tenths of the Japanese have no part
in the law-making. In Mexico, the gap between the educated classes and
the peons is fully as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href=
"#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>great as, if not greater than, the
gap between the extremes of Filipino society. Those who question the
capacity of the Filipinos for self-government forget that <i>patriotism
raises up persons fitted for the work that needs to be
done</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7227src" href="#xd27e7227"
name="xd27e7227src">11</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is because I believe that in the Philippines we are doing
ourselves an injustice and keeping back the progress of the world by
depreciating and scoffing at the value of patriotism as a factor in
self-government and in the maintenance of free institutions, that I
have written this book. There is no more patriotic people in the world
than the Filipino people. I base this opinion upon an intimate
knowledge of them, and in the light of considerable observation
throughout most of Europe, and in Asia from the Golden Horn to the
mouth of the Yang-tse. Woe to the nonsense, sometimes ignorant,
sometimes vicious, wherewith we are regaled from time to time by
Americans who go to Manila, smoke a cigar or two in some American club
there, and then come back home and depreciate the Filipino people
without at least correcting Col. Roosevelt&rsquo;s wholly uninformed
and cruel random assertions of 1900 about the Filipinos being a
&ldquo;jumble of savage tribes,&rdquo; and about Aguinaldo being
&ldquo;the Osceola of the Filipinos,&rdquo; or their &ldquo;Sitting
Bull!&rdquo; It is wonderfully inspiring to turn from such stale
slander to Mr. Bryan&rsquo;s above statement of the case for our
Oriental subjects, a statement framed in his own infinitely sympathetic
and inimitable way, which says for me just what I had long wanted to
express, but could not, so well. And in the midst of the recurring
slander that the Filipino people are &ldquo;a heterogeneous lot,&rdquo;
it is refreshing to find in a preface to the American Census of the
Philippines of 1903, by the Director thereof, a passage where, in
comparing the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span>tables of that census with those of the Twelfth
Census of the United States, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Those of the Philippine Census are somewhat
simpler, the differences being due mainly to <i>the more homogeneous
character of the population of the Philippine
Islands</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7243src" href=
"#xd27e7243" name="xd27e7243src">12</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we consider the above in the light of the past and present
operation of our own immigration laws, it is not flattering, but it may
and should tend to awaken some realization of the manifold nature and
blinding effects of current misapprehensions in the United States
concerning the inhabitants of the Philippines. One Filipino does not
differ from another any more than one American does from another
American&mdash;in fact they differ less, considering immigration. The
Filipino people are not rendered a heterogeneous lot by having three
different languages, Ilocano, Tagalo, and Visayan,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e7250src" href="#xd27e7250" name="xd27e7250src">13</a> which
are respectively the languages spoken in the northern, the central, and
the southern part of their country, any more than the people of
Switzerland are rendered heterogeneous by the circumstance that in
northern Switzerland you find German spoken for the most part, while
farther south you find French, and near the southernmost extremities
some Italian. At this late date no credible person acquainted with the
facts will be so poor in spirit as to deny that the motives of the men
who originally started the insurrection were patriotic. Nor will any
one who served under General Otis&rsquo;s command in the Philippines
deny that that eminent desk soldier continued to cling to his early
theory that it was a purely Tagalo insurrection long after the deadly
unanimity of the opposition had seeped, with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span>all-pervading thoroughness, into the general
mind of the army of occupation. The white flag or rag of truce,
<i>alias</i> treachery, used to be hoisted to put us off our guard in
pretence of welcome to our columns approaching their towns and barrios.
Such use of such a flag, followed by treachery, the ultimate weapon of
the weak, had been in turn followed, with relentless impartiality in
countless instances, by due unloosening of the vials of American wrath,
until every <i>nipa</i> shack<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7261src" href=
"#xd27e7261" name="xd27e7261src">14</a> in the Philippine Islands that
remained unburned had had its lesson, written in the blood of its
occupants or their kin, to the tune of the Krag-Jorgensen or the
Gatling. Yet General Otis&rsquo;s reports are always bland, and always
convey the idea of an insurrection exclusively Tagalo.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1900, the newly arrived civilians, the Taft
Commission, had no special interest in the soldiers who, for better,
for worse, were &ldquo;doing their country&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; as
Kipling calls his own country&rsquo;s countless wars against its
refractory subjects in the far East; and no especial sympathy with that
work. Two years later we find President Roosevelt, in connection with
the general amnesty of July 4, 1902, congratulating his &ldquo;bowld
lads,&rdquo; as Mr. Dooley would call them&mdash;meaning General
Chaffee and the Eighth Army Corps&mdash;on a total of &ldquo;two
thousand combats, great and small&rdquo; up to that time, but you never
find in any of Governor Taft&rsquo;s Philippine state papers any more
affirmative recognition of continued resistance to American rule than
some mild allusion to &ldquo;small but hard knocks&rdquo; being
administered here and there by the army. From the beginning there was a
systematic belittling, on the part of the Taft Commission, of the work
of the army, incidentally to belittling the reality and unanimity
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>of the opposition which was daily calling it
forth.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7271src" href="#xd27e7271" name=
"xd27e7271src">15</a> This was not vicious. It was essentially
benevolent. It was part of the initial fermentation of their
preconceived theory. But the trouble about their theory was that it was
only a theory. It would not square with the facts. They were trying to
square the subjugation of the Philippines with the freeing of Cuba, a
task quite as soluble as the squaring of a circle. They hoped, with all
the kindly benevolence of Mr. McKinley himself, that the opposition to
our rule was not as great as some people seemed to think. They had come
out to the islands earnestly wishing to find conditions not as bad as
they had been asserted to be. And the wish became father to the thought
and the thought soon found expression in words&mdash;cablegrams to the
United States presenting an optimistic view as to the prospects of
necessity for further shedding of blood in the interest of Benevolent
Assimilation, alias Trade Expansion. Some flippant person will say,
&ldquo;That is a polite way of charging insincerity.&rdquo; This book
is not addressed to flippant persons. It is a serious attempt to deal
with a problem involving the liberties of a whole people, and will be,
as far as the writer can make it, straightforward, dignified, and
candid. Judge Taft&rsquo;s fearful mistake of 1900&ndash;1901 in the
matter of his premature planting of the civil government&mdash;a
mistake because based on the idea that &ldquo;the great majority of the
people&rdquo; welcomed American rule, and a fearful mistake because
fraught <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name=
"pb301">301</a>]</span>with so much subsequent sacrifice of life due to
too early withdrawal of the police protection of the army&mdash;was not
the first instance in American history where an ordinarily level-headed
public man has, with egregious folly, mistaken the mood and temper of a
whole people. The key to his mistake lay in the fact that, coming into
a strange country in the midst of a war, he ignored the advice of the
commanding general of the army of his country concerning the military
situation, and took the advice of a few native Tories, or Copperheads,
of wealth, who had never really been in sympathy with the insurrection
and who, flocking about him as soon as he arrived, told him what he so
longed to be told, viz., that the war did not represent the wishes of
the people but was kept up by &ldquo;a conspiracy of
assassination&rdquo; of all who did not contribute to it either in
service or money. He thereupon decided that the men who told him this
really represented the voice of the people, and that the men in the
field who had then been keeping up the struggle for independence for
sixteen months, in season and out of season, were simply &ldquo;a Mafia
on a very large scale.&rdquo; Consequently the Taft Commission had been
in the islands less than three months when Secretary of War Root at
Washington was giving the widest possible publicity to cablegrams from
them, such as that dated August 21, 1900, mentioned in the preceding
chapter, conveying the glad tidings that &ldquo;large number of people
long for peace and are willing to accept government under United
States&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7279src" href="#xd27e7279"
name="xd27e7279src">16</a>; and by November next thereafter, the
&ldquo;large number&rdquo; had grown to &ldquo;a great majority,&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;willing&rdquo; to &ldquo;entirely willing.&rdquo; The
November statement was: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href=
"#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>A great majority</i> of the people long for peace
and are <i>entirely</i> willing to accept the establishment of a
government under the supremacy of the United States.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e7294src" href="#xd27e7294" name="xd27e7294src">17</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet, as we saw in the preceding chapter, the real situation in the
Philippines at this very time was described four years later at the
Republican National Convention of 1904 by Mr. Root thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">When the last national convention met, over 70,000
American soldiers from more than 500 stations held a still vigorous
enemy in check.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between the date of their arrival in the Islands on June 3d, and the
date of this August 21st telegram, the Taft Commission did little
junketing, but remained in Manila imbibing the welcome views of the
&ldquo;Tories&rdquo; or &ldquo;Copperheads,&rdquo; and seeking very
little information from the army. But it so happens that the
Adjutant-General at Manila used to keep a record of the daily
engagements during that period, which record was later published in the
annual <i>War Department Report</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7312src" href="#xd27e7312" name="xd27e7312src">18</a> and it
shows a total of about five hundred killings (of Filipinos) between
June 3d, and August 21st, to say nothing of probably many times that
number hit but not killed, and therefore able to get away. (You could
not include any Filipino in your returns of your killings except dead
you had actually counted.) It also happens that on June 4th, the day
after Judge Taft&rsquo;s arrival, General MacArthur, in response to an
order from Washington sent some time previous at the instance of
Congress, had all the Filipino casualties our military records showed
up to that time (<i>i. e.</i>, during the sixteen months from the day
of the outbreak, February 4, 1899, to June 3, 1900), tabulated and
totalled, and the total Filipino <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303"
href="#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>killed accordingly reported
by cablegram to the War Department on June 4, 1900, was
10,780.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7322src" href="#xd27e7322" name=
"xd27e7322src">19</a></p>
<p>Ten thousand in sixteen months is 625 per month. So that by the time
Judge Taft arrived, the Filipinos had been sufficiently beaten into
submission to decrease the death-rate due to the Independence Bug from
something over six hundred per month to about two hundred per month.
Judge Taft called this enthusiasm. I call it exhaustion. Whereupon,
exclaims a Boston Anti-Imperialist, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you issue
Mr. Taft a certificate as a member of the Ananias Club at once, and be
done with it?&rdquo; My answer is that I do not believe the Taft
Commission in 1900 either knew these figures or wanted to know them.
They came out preaching a Gospel of Hope to the exclusion of all else,
a species of mental healing. They said, soothingly to Dame Filipina,
&ldquo;Be not afraid; you are well; you are well&rdquo;&mdash;of the
desire for independence she had conceived, when what that lady needed
was the surgical operation indispensable for the removal of a
still-born child.</p>
<p>The will of the American people is ascertainable, and quadrennially
announced, through certain prescribed methods. And (nearly) everybody
takes the result good-humoredly, God bless our country, whatever the
result. But just how Mr. Taft and his colleagues could assume to speak
for the &ldquo;great majority&rdquo; of the Filipino people at the
tremendous juncture in their destinies now under consideration during
the Presidential election of 1900, does not clearly appear, except that
in their first report they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Many witnesses were examined as to the form of
government best adapted to these islands and <i>satisfactory to the
people</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7337src" href="#xd27e7337" name=
"xd27e7337src">20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span></p>
<p>a statement which obviously takes for granted the only point
involved in the war, viz., whether <i>any kind</i> of alien government
would be &ldquo;satisfactory to the people.&rdquo; And in their various
other communications to Washington they describe themselves, with no
small degree of benevolent satisfaction, as enthusiastically received
by natives not under arms at the moment of such reception. As a matter
of fact, a carpet-bag governor of Georgia might just as well have
reported to Andrew Johnson an enthusiastic reception at the hands of
the people whose homes had lately been put to the torch, and their kith
and kin to the sword, while the whole fair face of nature from Atlanta
to the sea lay bruised and bleeding under the iron heel of
Sherman&rsquo;s army. Let no advocate of Indefinite Tutelage whet his
scalping-knife for me because of the use of that word
&ldquo;carpet-bag.&rdquo; It was as free from ill-will as the explosion
incident to flash-light photography. We are trying to develop a picture
of those times. Two at least of the Commission, Messrs. Taft and
Wright, were the kind of men who in all the personal relations of life,
meet the ultimate test of human confidence and friendship&mdash;you
would make either, if he would consent to act, executor of your will,
or testamentary guardian of your child. But they came out with the
preconceived notion that kindness would win the people over, whereas
what those people wanted was not foreign kindness but home rule, not
silken political swaddling clothes, but freedom. And as the acquisition
of the Philippines has placed us under the necessity of getting up a
new definition of freedom, one consistent with tariff taxation without
representation&mdash;through legislation by a Congress on the other
side of the world in which &ldquo;our new possessions&rdquo; have no
vote&mdash;it should be added that one of the things Freedom meant with
us before 1898, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305"
name="pb305">305</a>]</span>was freedom to frame the laws&mdash;tariff
and other&mdash;which largely determine the selling price of crops and
the purchase price of the necessities of life, freedom to see the
intelligent and educated men of your own race in charge of your common
destiny, freedom to have a flag as an emblem of your common interests,
in a word, just Freedom. And that was what the war was about. They
wanted to be free and independent. Whether they were fit for such
freedom is wholly foreign to the reality and unanimity of their desire
for it. General Otis used to be very fond of taking the wind out of the
sails of their commissioners and other officials before the outbreak by
saying that their people had not the slightest notion of what the word
independence meant. It is true that they knew nothing about it by
experience, but equally true that whatever it was, they wanted it. Of
the ten thousand men we had already killed when Judge Taft arrived,
there can be no question, as already heretofore suggested, that many of
them may have been hit just as they were hurrahing for independence, in
other words, died with the word &ldquo;Independence&rdquo; on their
lips. When men have been thus fighting against overwhelming odds for
some sixteen months for government <i>of their</i> people <i>by</i>
their people <i>for</i> their people&mdash;however inarticulate the
emotions of the rank and file on going into battle&mdash;it is idle to
claim that they do not know what they want, whether the great majority
of the rank and file can read and write or not. But pursuant to the
idea that kindness would cure the desire for independence, Judge Taft
ignored, in the outset, all advice from the military department,
because that was not the kindness department, accepting as truly
representative of the temper of the whole people the views of a few
ultra-conservatives of large means who had always been part and parcel
of the Spanish Administration. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306"
href="#pb306" name="pb306">306</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, General MacArthur and the whole Eighth Army Corps
had seen a great insurrection drag on from month to month and from one
year to another, under General Otis, when short shrift would have been
made of it in the outset, and far less life sacrificed, if Mr. McKinley
had not needed, in aid of his Philippine policy, the support of both of
those who believed it was right <i>and</i> of those who believed it
would pay. The one central thought which had seemed to animate General
Otis from the beginning, a thought which we have already traced through
all its humiliating manifestations, was that he must neither do or
permit anything that might hurt the Administration. When the
&ldquo;impatience of the people&rdquo; at home, which figures so
prominently in the correspondence already cited between the Adjutant
General of the army, General Corbin, and General Otis at Manila, had
begun to cast its shadows on the presidential year, 1900, the master
mind of Mr. Root had interrupted the fatal Otis treatment of the
insurrection, indicated by General Otis&rsquo;s long failure to call
for volunteers, his stupid stream of &ldquo;situation well in
hand&rdquo; and &ldquo;insurrection about to collapse&rdquo; telegrams,
and his utterly unpardonable persistence in calling it a purely
&ldquo;Tagalo insurrection,&rdquo; by sending him a competent force,
and a plan of campaign, and directing him to carry out the plan.
General Otis did this, because he was told to, and then began again to
sing the same old song. MacArthur, Wheaton, Lawton, Bates, Young,
Funston, and the rest of the fighting generals, had submitted to all
the Otis follies without a murmur, because insubordination degrades an
army into a rabble. But they<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7366src" href=
"#xd27e7366" name="xd27e7366src">21</a> believed the army <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>was
there to put down that insurrection, not to have a symposium with its
leaders on the rights of man. They had taken up &ldquo;The White
Man&rsquo;s Burden,&rdquo; after the manner of Lords Kitchener and
Roberts, and they had no qualms. Above all, they wanted <i>peace</i>,
no matter how much fighting it took to get it. Mindful of the attempts
of the Schurman Commission of the year before to mix peace with war,
and of the immense encouragement thus given the insurgents, they had
not looked forward with enthusiasm to the coming of the Taft
Commission, and to the highly probable renewal of negotiations with the
insurgent leaders in the field, pursuant to a presidential policy of
patching up a peace at any price, suggested by the exigencies of
political expediency, to give the government a semblance of having more
or less of the consent of the governed. That the anticipations of the
military authorities in this regard did not receive a pleasant
disappointment, has already been suggested by the nature of the views
adopted by the commission soon after its arrival.</p>
<p>The military view of the situation, as it stood when Judge Taft and
his colleagues arrived at Manila in June, 1900, is set forth in the
annual report of the commanding general, General MacArthur, rendered
shortly thereafter; rendered, not in aid of any political candidate at
home, nor of a sudden, but at the usual and customary annual season for
the making of such reports; and rendered by a soldier of no mean
experience and ability, who was a man of great kindliness of heart as
well, to the war department of his government, to acquaint it with the
facts of a military situation he had been dealing with for two years
prior to the arrival of the Taft Commission. General MacArthur&rsquo;s
views, as expressed in his report, must now be contrasted with the Taft
view, not to show that MacArthur is a bigger <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>man
than Taft, nor for any other idle or petty purpose, but because, if, in
1900, General MacArthur was right, and Judge Taft was wrong, about the
unanimity of the whole Filipino people against us, then the institution
of the Civil Government of the Philippines on July 4, 1901, was
premature; and, therefore, by reason of the withdrawal of the strong
arm of the military at a critical period of public order, it was not
calculated to give adequate protection to the lives and property of
those who were willing to abandon the struggle for independence and
submit to our rule. And if, as we shall see later, it did in fact
grossly fail to afford such adequate protection for life and property,
it was derelict in the most sacred duty enjoined upon it by Mr.
McKinley&rsquo;s instructions to the Taft Commission. But first let me
introduce you to General MacArthur.</p>
<p>General MacArthur is not only a soldier of a high order of ability,
but a statesman as well. Moreover, he was a thoroughgoing
&ldquo;expansionist.&rdquo; He believed in keeping the Philippines
permanently, just as England does her colonies. But he was perfectly
honest about it. He recognized the fact that they were against our
rule. But he did not attach any more weight to that circumstance than
Lord Kitchener would have done. Also, he had come out to the islands
with the first expedition, in 1898, had been in the field continuously
for fifteen months prior to assuming supreme military command, and knew
the Filipinos thoroughly. As soon as he took command, on May 5, 1900,
of the 70,000 troops then in the Islands, he set himself with patience
and firmness to the great task of ending the insurrection, which at
that time promised to continue indefinitely, the far more formidable
guerrilla warfare that had followed the brief period of serried
resistance having now settled down to a chronic stage, aided and
abetted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>by the whole population. I have said General
MacArthur was a &ldquo;thoroughgoing&rdquo; expansionist. This needs a
slight qualification. At first he appears to have had a few qualms.
Shortly after the outbreak of the war with the Filipinos, when he took
the first insurgent capital Malolos, in March, 1899, he had said at
Malolos, as we have seen, to a newspaper man who accompanied the
expedition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">When I first started in against these rebels, I
believed that Aguinaldo&rsquo;s troops represented only a faction. I
did not believe that the whole population of Luzon was opposed to us;
but I have been <i>reluctantly</i> compelled to believe that the
Filipinos are loyal to Aguinaldo and the government which he
represents.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7388src" href="#xd27e7388" name=
"xd27e7388src">22</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>General MacArthur&rsquo;s reports concerning the war in the
Philippines during the period of his command are succinct and luminous.
He makes it perfectly clear that the original resistance offered by the
insurgent armies in the field after the arrival of the overwhelmingly
ample reinforcements sent out from this country in the fall of 1899,
was little more than a mere flash in the pan, compared with the
well-planned scheme of resistance which followed the dispersion of
those armies to the several provinces which had furnished them to the
cause, and Aguinaldo&rsquo;s simultaneous flight into the mountains
&ldquo;with his government concealed about his person,&rdquo; as
Senator Lodge exultantly described that incident in his speech of
April, 1900, in defence of the Administration&rsquo;s Philippine
policy. Speaking of this period, General MacArthur says: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">It has since been ascertained that the expediency of
adopting guerrilla warfare from the inception of hostilities was
seriously discussed by the native leaders, and advocated with much
emphasis as the system best adapted to the peculiar conditions of the
struggle. It was finally determined, however, that a concentrated field
army, conducting regular operations, would, in the event of success,
attract the favorable attention of the world, and be accepted as a
practical demonstration of capacity for organization and
self-government. The disbandment of the field army, therefore, having
been a subject of contemplation from the start, the actual event, in
pursuance of the deliberate action of the council of war in Bayambang
about November 12, 1899 (already hereinbefore noticed), <i>was not
regarded by Filipinos in the light of a calamity, but simply as a
transition from one form of action to another</i>; a change which by
many was regarded as a positive advantage, and was relied upon to
accomplish more effectively the end in view. The Filipino idea behind
the dissolution of their field army was not at the time of the
occurrence well understood in the American camp. As a consequence,
misleading conclusions were reached to the effect that the insurrection
itself had been destroyed, and that it only remained to sweep up the
fag ends of the rebel army by a system of police administration not
likely to be either onerous or dangerous.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7403src" href="#xd27e7403" name="xd27e7403src">23</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his report covering the period from May 5th, to October 1, 1900,
General MacArthur says of the policy of resistance above outlined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The country affords great advantages for the practical
development of such a policy. The practice of discarding the uniform
enables the insurgents to appear and disappear almost at their
convenience. At one time they are in the ranks as soldiers, and
immediately thereafter are within the American lines in the attitude of
peaceful natives, absorbed in <i>a dense mass of sympathetic
people</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7416src" href="#xd27e7416" name=
"xd27e7416src">24</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span></p>
<p>In this same connection the report includes a copy of the original
order of the insurgent government which was the corner stone of the
guerrilla policy, and states that &ldquo;systemized regulations&rdquo;
for its effective prosecution throughout the archipelago had been
compiled and published by the Filipino junta, or revolutionary
committee at Madrid, and distributed among the insurgent forces. The
report also appends a copy of the &ldquo;Army Regulations&rdquo; under
which the insurgent forces were to conduct the guerrilla warfare. It
also describes in detail the system of warfare prescribed under these
regulations, and states that as a result of the measures which he,
General MacArthur, took to combat that warfare &ldquo;the 53 stations
of American troops occupied in the archipelago on November 1, 1899, had
on September 1, 1900, expanded to 413,&rdquo; and that during this
period, the casualties to our troops were 268 killed, 750 wounded, 55
captured, and to the insurgents, so far as our records showed, 3227
killed, 694 wounded, and 2864 captured. Says he:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The extensive distribution of troops has strained the
soldiers of the army to the full limit of endurance. Each little
command has had to provide its own service of security and information
by never ceasing patrols, explorations, escorts, outposts, and regular
guards. An idea seems to have been established in the public mind [he
meant the public mind at home, of course] that the field work of the
army is in the nature of police, in regulating a few bands of
guerrillas, and involving none of the vicissitudes of war. [Here he is
meeting the Otis theory, then being industriously circulated in the
United States.] <i>Such a narrow statement of the case is unfair to the
service.</i> In all things requiring endurance, fortitude, and patient
diligence, the guerrilla period has been pre-eminent. It is difficult
for the non-professional observer [he means Judge Taft] to understand
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>that apparently desultory work, such as has
prevailed in the Philippines during the past ten months,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e7432src" href="#xd27e7432" name=
"xd27e7432src">25</a> has demanded <i>more of discipline and as much of
valor</i> as was required during the period of regular operations
against the concentrated field forces of the insurrection. It is,
therefore, a great privilege to speak warmly in respect of the
importance of the service rendered day by day, with unremitting
vigilance, by the splendid men who,&rdquo; etc.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7438src" href="#xd27e7438" name="xd27e7438src">26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was not until July 4, 1902, that President Roosevelt officially
declared, by his amnesty proclamation of that date that the
insurrection in the Philippines was at last ended. It was by no means
beaten to a frazzle, as we shall later see. But of course, knowing the
impatience of a large portion of the American people with a situation
about which there was a wide-spread notion that much remained
undisclosed, Mr. Roosevelt would have issued such a proclamation
earlier, had the facts seemed to him to so authorize. General
MacArthur&rsquo;s relentless &ldquo;never ceasing patrols,
explorations,&rdquo; etc., continued straight on through the
presidential campaign of 1900 side by side in point of time with the
roseate Taft cablegrams of the same period, and long
thereafter&mdash;how long will be later indicated. Says General
MacArthur, in his report for 1901:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">It had been suggested that some of the Filipino
leaders were willing to submit the issue to the judgment of the
American people, which was soon to be expressed at the polls, and to
abide by the result of the presidential election of November,
1900.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7448src" href="#xd27e7448" name=
"xd27e7448src">27</a> But subsequent events demonstrated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>that
the hope of ending the war without further effusion of blood was not
well founded, and that as a matter of fact the Filipinos were
<i>organizing for further desperate resistance</i> by means of a
general banding of the people in support of the guerrillas in the
field.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7462src" href="#xd27e7462" name=
"xd27e7462src">28</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>General MacArthur then goes on to tell how, as part of this
programme, the insurgent authorities,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">announced a primal and inflexible principle, to the
effect that every native, without any exception, residing within the
limits of the archipelago, owed active allegiance to the insurgent
cause. This jurisdiction was enjoined under severe penalties, which
were systematically enforced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what Judge Taft afterwards described as &ldquo;a conspiracy
of murder, a Mafia on a very large scale&rdquo;,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7476src" href="#xd27e7476" name="xd27e7476src">29</a> the
characterization being made in support of his theory that &ldquo;the
great majority of the people&rdquo; with whom we were then at war would
welcome our rule if allowed to follow their real preferences, and that
they were being cruelly coerced to fight for the independence of their
country. General MacArthur&rsquo;s view, however, did not support this
theory. His report deals with this branch of the subject thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The cohesion of Filipino society in behalf of
insurgent interests is most emphatically illustrated by the fact that
assassination, which was extensively employed, was generally accepted
as a legitimate expression of insurgent governmental authority. <i>The
individuals marked for death would not appeal to American protection,
although condemned exclusively on account of supposed
pro-Americanism.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on, when we came to understand the Filipinos better, this
summary method of dealing with the faint-hearted <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>lost
much of its initial horrifying force, and the failure of such to appeal
to us for protection lost much of its strangeness. In the first place,
nobody loves a traitor. Even those to whom he claims to have betrayed
his countrymen do not trust him implicitly. Again, Latin countries
never assume that before a man is punished for alleged crime he has
been confronted with the witnesses against him. Such testimony is,
under their jurisprudence, frequently received in his absence. The
legal department of General MacArthur&rsquo;s office once got hold of a
captured insurgent paper subscribed with the autograph of Juan Cailles,
one of their best generals. It directed that a named Filipino residing
in a certain town garrisoned by American troops be executed&mdash;we of
course, would call it &ldquo;assassinated&rdquo;&mdash;at a certain
hour on a certain day in a public street of the town, and that the
soldier or soldiers performing the &ldquo;execution&rdquo; should
declare to the bystanders, if any, in so doing, that it was done
because the man was a traitor, a friend of the Americans. We kept this
paper, intending to hang Juan whenever he should be captured. He held
out a long time, and finally surrendered unconditionally&mdash;but he
proved such an elegant fellow, game as a pebble, courteous as
Chesterfield, and immensely popular with his people, that it was
decided he could be of more service as a live governor of a province
than he could as a dead general,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7492src"
href="#xd27e7492" name="xd27e7492src">30</a> so he was appointed a
provincial governor by Governor Taft, and made a splendid official.</p>
<p>Another reason why Filipinos suspected, during the insurrection, by
the more obstinate and stout-hearted <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb315" href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>of their compatriots
who held out longer in the struggle for independence, of weakening
toward the cause of their country, in other words, suspected of what
might be called &ldquo;Copperhead&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tory&rdquo;
tendencies, would not appeal to us for protection, is strikingly
presented in General MacArthur&rsquo;s report for 1901. He says they
naturally had &ldquo;grave doubt as to the wisdom&rdquo; of siding with
us, &ldquo;as the United States had made no formal announcement of an
inflexible purpose to hold the archipelago and afford protection to
pro-Americans.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7502src" href=
"#xd27e7502" name="xd27e7502src">31</a></p>
<p>The one great thing that has crippled progress in the Philippines
from the beginning of the American occupation down to date is the
uncertainty as to what our policy for the future is to be, the lack of
some, &ldquo;formal announcement of an inflexible purpose.&rdquo; And
of course I mean, as General MacArthur meant, by
&ldquo;<i>formal</i>&rdquo; announcement, an authoritative declaration
by <i>the law-making power</i> of the government. If Congress should
formally declare that it is the purpose of this government to hold the
Philippines permanently, American and other capital would at once go
there in abundance and the place would &ldquo;blossom like a
rose.&rdquo; If, on the other hand, Congress should formally declare
that it is the purpose of this government to give the Filipinos their
independence as soon as a stable native government can be set up, thus
holding out to the present generation the prospect of living to see the
independence of their country, the place would also quickly blossom as
aforesaid, through the generous ardor of native love of country. In
either event, everybody out there would know where he is
&ldquo;at.&rdquo; At present all is uncertainty, both with the resident
members of the dominant alien race, and with those over whom we are
ruling. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name=
"pb316">316</a>]</span></p>
<p>It took over 120,000 American troops, first and last, to put down
the struggle of the Filipinos for independence.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7518src" href="#xd27e7518" name="xd27e7518src">32</a> The war
began February 4, 1899, and the last public official announcement that
it was ended was on July 4, 1902.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7521src"
href="#xd27e7521" name="xd27e7521src">33</a> Of course this does not
imply that every province was at all times during that period a theatre
of actual war. Putting down the insurrection was something like putting
out a fire in a field of dry grass. At first the trouble was general.
Gradually it diminished toward the end. But for a while, no sooner was
it quenched in one province than it would break out in another. How the
Filipinos were able to prolong the struggle as long as they did against
such apparently overwhelming odds is most interestingly explained by
General MacArthur in his report for 1900. After describing the method
he followed of establishing native municipal governments in territory
as conquered, he says, with a patient stateliness that is almost
humorous:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The institution of municipal government under American
auspices, of course, carried the idea of exclusive fidelity to the
sovereign power of the United States. All the necessary moral
obligations to that end were readily assumed by municipal bodies, and
all outward forms of loyalty and decorum carefully preserved. But
precisely at this point the psychologic conditions referred to above
[meaning the unity against us],<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7527src"
href="#xd27e7527" name="xd27e7527src">34</a> began to work with great
energy, in assistance of insurgent field operations. For this purpose
most of the towns secretly organized complete insurgent municipal
governments, to proceed <i>simultaneously and in the same sphere as the
American governments and</i> in many instances <i>through the same
personnel</i>&mdash;that is to say, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb317" href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>presidentes and town
officials acted openly in behalf of the Americans and secretly in
behalf of the insurgents, and, paradoxical as it may seem, with
considerable apparent solicitude for the interests of both. In all
matters touching the peace of the town, the regulation of markets, the
primitive work possible on roads, streets, and bridges, and the
institution of schools, their open activity was commendable; at the
same time they were exacting and collecting contributions and supplies
and recruiting men for the Filipino forces, and sending all obtainable
military information to the Filipino leaders. Wherever, throughout the
archipelago, there is a group of the insurgent army, it is a fact
beyond dispute, that all contiguous towns contribute to the maintenance
thereof. In other words, the towns, regardless of the fact of American
occupation and town organization, are the actual bases for all
insurgent military activities; and not only so in the sense of
furnishing supplies for the so-called flying columns of guerrillas, but
as affording secure places of refuge. Indeed, it is now the most
important maxim of Filipino tactics to disband when closely pressed and
seek safety in the nearest <i>barrio</i>; a man&oelig;uvre quickly
accomplished by reason of the assistance of the people and the ease
with which the Filipino soldier is transformed into the appearance of a
peaceful native.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7545src" href="#xd27e7545"
name="xd27e7545src">35</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To contrast a cold, hard military fact involving the lives of
American soldiers with a lot of political nonsense intended for
consumption in the United States during a presidential election, the
next paragraph is particularly interesting in the light of the
cotemporaneous Taft view:<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7553src" href=
"#xd27e7553" name="xd27e7553src">36</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>The success of this unique system of war depends
upon almost complete unity of action of the entire native population.
That <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>such unity is a fact is too obvious to admit of
discussion.</i> Intimidation has undoubtedly accomplished much to this
end, but fear as the only motive is hardly sufficient to account for
the <i>united and apparently spontaneous action of several millions of
people</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7566src" href="#xd27e7566" name=
"xd27e7566src">37</a> One traitor in each town would effectually
destroy such a complex organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then follows this bit of grim humor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>It is more probable that the adhesive principle
comes from ethnological homogeneity which induces men to respond for a
time to the appeals of consanguineous leadership</i>&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in other words, to stick to <i>their own kith and kin</i>. He had in
a previous paragraph used that very expression thus: &ldquo;The people
seem to be actuated by the idea that in politics or war men are never
nearer right then when going with their own kith and kin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In all the foregoing, General MacArthur was not simply trying to
score a point against Judge Taft, though his resentment of the effort
of the Taft Commission of 1900 to mix politics with war in the
presidential year was quite as decided, and quite as well known in the
islands at the time, as was General Otis&rsquo;s similar attitude
toward the Schurman Commission of the previous year.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e7588src" href="#xd27e7588" name="xd27e7588src">38</a> He is
simply laying before the War <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href=
"#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span>Department, as a soldier, the
familiar facts of a situation which he had been dealing with for two
years past, as well known to the 70,000 officers and men under his
command as to himself. And as the details into which he goes are simply
prefatory to an account of the remedy he applied to the situation, that
remedy must now claim our attention. The remedy General MacArthur
finally applied was a proclamation, explaining to the Filipino
people&mdash;&ldquo;to all classes throughout the archipelago,&rdquo;
it read, and especially to the leaders in the field, many of whose
captured comrades-in-arms he had now become thoroughly acquainted
with&mdash;the severities sanctioned by the laws of civilized nations
under such circumstances, and the reasons therefor; and, further,
serving them with notice that thenceforward he proposed to enforce
those laws with full rigor.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7598src" href=
"#xd27e7598" name="xd27e7598src">39</a></p>
<p>The eminent lawyers of the Taft Commission were too busy about that
time acquainting themselves with the situation through natives not in
arms, to attach much importance to General MacArthur&rsquo;s
proclamation, but the Eighth Army Corps always believed that that
proclamation, and the army&rsquo;s work under it, was the main factor
in making the civil government at all possible by the date it was set
up, July 4, 1901. The issuance of this document was not only a wise
military move, but a subtle stroke of statesmanship as well. It assumed
that the Filipino people were a <i>civilized people</i>, an assumption
never indulged by Spain during the whole of her rule, but always freely
admitted by General MacArthur in all his dealings with their leading
men to be a fact. It therefore appealed to their <i lang="fr">amour
propre</i>, and to the <i lang="fr">noblesse oblige</i> of many of the
most obstinate and trusted fighting leaders. The writer was, at the
date of the proclamation under consideration, on duty <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>at
General MacArthur&rsquo;s headquarters, as assistant to Colonel
Crowder, his judge advocate, now Judge Advocate General of the United
States Army, and prepared the first rough, tentative suggestions for
the final draft of it, accompanying such suggestions with a memorandum
showing the course taken by Wellington in France in 1815, and by
Bismarck&rsquo;s generals at the close of the Franco-Prussian War, as
well as that followed under General Order No. 100, 1863, for the
government of the armies of the United States in the field. Having then
entertained the opinion that that proclamation, though drastic, was
wise and right under the facts of the situation which confronted us,
and having nowise changed that opinion since, it may be well for the
writer of this book to explain his reasons for that opinion. This must
be done wholly without reference to &ldquo;the authorities,&rdquo; for
neither at the bar of public opinion, nor at the bar of final judgment,
do &ldquo;the authorities&rdquo; count for much. In so doing, however,
we must start with the <i>assumption</i> that it was a case of American
military occupation of hostile territory, notwithstanding that Judge
Taft began soon after his arrival in the islands in the June previous
to the December now referred to, to cable home impressions which, if
correct, amounted to a denial that the great body of the people were
hostile. Military occupation is a fact which admits of no debate, and
the necessity of making your country&rsquo;s flag respected is always
fully and keenly recognized as the one supreme consideration by every
good American except one who, obsessed with the idea that kindness will
cure the desire of a people for independence, proceeds to act on that
idea in the midst of a war for independence.</p>
<p>Under the laws of war the commanding general of the occupying force
owes protection, both of life and property, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>to
all persons residing within the territory occupied. The object of
General MacArthur&rsquo;s proclamation was to put a stop to such
&ldquo;executions,&rdquo; or assassinations, as that perpetrated by
Juan Cailles, mentioned above, and to separate the insurgents in the
field from their main reliance, the towns. The latter end of a bloody
war is no time for a discussion of the causes of the war between victor
and vanquished. Nor is it any time to believe the representative of the
enemy who tells you that most of him is really in sympathy with you and
merely coerced. Your duty is to stop the war. You and your enemy having
had a difference, and having referred it to the arbitrament of war,
which is, unfortunately, at present the only human jurisdiction having
power to enforce decisions concerning such differences, if you win, and
your enemy refuses to abide the decision, he is simply, as it were in
contempt of court, and, in the scheme of things, as at present ordered,
deserves punishment as an enemy to the general peace. To state the
ethics of the matter juridically, &ldquo;there should be an end of
litigation&rdquo;&mdash;somewhere.</p>
<p>I do not believe in the doctrine that might makes right, and I
cherish the high hope that this human family of ours will survive to
see war superseded, as the ultimate arbiter, by something more like
heaven and less like hell. But in the Philippines in 1900 it was a
situation, not a theory, that confronted us, and, as far as my
consciously fallible thinking apparatus lights the way which then lay
before us, that way led to a shrine whereon was written &ldquo;A life
for a life.&rdquo; This is no mere academic discussion. With me it is a
tremendously practical one. In the gravest possible acceptation of the
term it is <span class="sc">awe</span>-fully so. If I am wrong, every
execution I approved by memorandum review furnished <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>Colonel Crowder and General MacArthur, of
military commission findings out there was wrong, and so were a number
of the executions I ordered as a judge appointed by Governor Taft under
a government which, though nominally a civil government, was no more
&ldquo;civil&rdquo; in so far as that term implies absence of necessity
for the presence of military force, than other governments immediately
following conquest usually are. The propriety of the imposition of
capital punishment by the constituted authorities of a nation as part
of a set policy to make its sovereignty respected, is wholly
independent of whether you call your colonial government a civil or a
military one. So that in justifying General MacArthur I am also
justifying Governor Taft, and as it was on the recommendation of the
former that the latter appointed me to the Bench, we are certainly all
three in the same boat in the matter of the capital punishments under
consideration. And while the company you were in on earth in a given
transaction, however distinguished that company, is not going to help
you with the Recording Angel,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7632src" href=
"#xd27e7632" name="xd27e7632src">40</a> still, it is some comfort to
know that wiser and abler men than yourself approved a course of
imposing capital punishments to which you were a party, such
punishments having been inflicted as part of a policy whose subsequent
evolution revealed it to you as fundamentally wrong. And this
reflection is quite relevant in the present connection to the question
whether the government of Benevolent <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb323" href="#pb323" name="pb323">323</a>]</span>Assimilation we have
maintained over the Filipinos for the last fourteen years is one which
was originally imposed by force against their will, or whether it was
ever welcomed by them or any considerable fraction of them.</p>
<p>That the MacArthur proclamation of December 20, 1900, concerning the
laws of war, was at the time a military necessity, is as perfectly
clear to me now as it was then. And yet it may well give the thoughtful
and patriotic American pause. It is sometimes difficult to understand
why men are so often entirely willing to go on fighting and dying in a
cause they must know to be hopeless. The famous passage of Edmund
Burke&rsquo;s speech on &ldquo;Conciliation with America,&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">If I were an American, as I am an Englishman, so long
as foreign troops remained on my native soil, I never would lay down my
arms, no, never, never, never!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>sounds well to us, but from the standpoint of a conqueror, there is
a good deal of wind-jamming to it, after all. It was the language of a
man who knew nothing of the horrors of war by actual experience, or of
what hell it slowly becomes to everybody concerned after most of the
high officials of the vanquished government have been captured and are
sleeping on dry, warm beds, eating good wholesome food, and smoking
good cigars, in comfortable custody, while the vanquished army, no
longer strong enough to come out in the open and fight, is relegated to
ambuscades and other tactics equally akin to the methods of the
assassin. The law of nations in this regard is an expression of the
views of successive generations of civilized and enlightened men of all
nations <i>whose profession</i> was war&mdash;men familiar with the
horrors inevitably incident to it and anxious to mitigate them as far
as possible. That law represents <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324"
href="#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span>the common consensus of
Christendom resulting from that experience. It recognizes that after
resistance becomes utterly hopeless, it becomes a crime against society
and the general peace, and this is wholly independent of the merits or
demerits of the questions involved in the war. In other words, the
greatest good of the greatest number cries aloud that the war must
stop. The cold, hard fact is that the great majority of the men who
hold out longest are, usually, either single men having no one
dependent on them, or nothing to lose, or both, or else they are men
more or less indifferent to the ties of family affection, and callous
to the suffering fruitlessly entailed upon innocent noncombatants by
the various and sundry horrors of war, such as decimation of the plough
animals of the country due to their running at large without caretakers
or forage; resultant untilled fields and scant food; pestilence and
famine consequent upon insufficient nourishment; arson, robbery, rape,
and murder inevitably committed in such times by sorry scamps and
ruffians claiming to be patriots but yielding no allegiance to any
responsible head; and so on, <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>
<p>General MacArthur&rsquo;s proclamation of December 20, 1900, served
notice on the leaders of a hopeless cause that assassinations, such as
that ordered by Juan Cailles, above mentioned, must stop; that the
universal practice of the townfolk, of sending money, supplies, and
information concerning our movements to the enemy in the field, must
stop; that participating in hostilities intermittently, in citizen
garb, followed by return to home and avocation when too hard pressed,
must stop; in short that <i>the war must stop</i>. Yet the proclamation
explained in so firm and kindly a way why the penalties it promised
were only reasonable under the circumstances, that &ldquo;as an
educational document <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325"
name="pb325">325</a>]</span>the effect was immediate and
far-reaching,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7660src" href=
"#xd27e7660" name="xd27e7660src">41</a> to quote from an opinion
expressed by its author in the body of it, an opinion entirely
consistent with modesty and fully justified by the facts. General
MacArthur also goes on to say of his unrelenting and rigid enforcement
of the terms of this proclamation that the results &ldquo;preclude all
possibility of doubt *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* that the effective pacification of
the archipelago <i>commenced</i> December 20, 1900&rdquo;&mdash;its
date. It is a part of the history of those times, familiar to all who
are familiar with them, that the Taft Civil Commission thought its
assurances of the benevolent intentions of our government were what
made the civil government possible by midsummer, 1901. But whatever the
Filipinos may think of us at present, now that they understand us
better, certainly in 1900&ndash;01, in view of the events of the
preceding two or three years, which formed the basis of the only
acquaintance they then had with us, and in view of the fact that their
experience for the preceding two or three hundred years had made force
the only effective governmental argument with them, and governmental
promises a mere mockery, and in view of the fact that the
&ldquo;never-ceasing patrols, explorations, escorts, outposts,&rdquo;
etc., of General MacArthur&rsquo;s 70,000 men were relentlessly kept up
during the six months immediately following the proclamation and in aid
of it, it at once becomes obvious how infinitesimal a fraction of the
final partial pacification which made the civil government possible,
the Taft assurances to the Filipinos as to our intentions must have
been. These matters are of prime importance to any honest effort toward
a clear understanding of present conditions, because far and away the
greatest wrong which we, in our genuinely benevolent misinformation,
have done the Filipinos, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href=
"#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span>not even excepting the tariff
legislation perpetrated upon them by Congress, lies in the insufferably
hypocritical pretence that they ever consented to our rule, or that
they consent to it now&mdash;a pretence conceived in 1898 by Trade
Expansion, to beguile a nation the breath of whose own life is
political liberty based on consent of the governed, into a career of
conquest, but not even countenanced since by those who believe the
Government should go into the politico-missionary business, after the
manner of Spain in the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>Having now exhaustively examined the differences of opinion between
Judge Taft and General MacArthur, when the former set to work, in the
summer of 1900, to get a civil government started by the date of
expiration of the term of enlistment of the volunteer army (June 30,
1901), let us follow the facts of the situation up to the date last
named, or, which is practically the same thing, up to the inauguration
of Judge Taft as Civil Governor of the islands on July 4, 1901,
pausing, in passing, for such reflections as may force themselves upon
us as pertinent to the Philippine problem of to-day.</p>
<p>On September 19, 1900, General MacArthur wired Secretary of War
Root&mdash;General Corbin, the Adjutant-General of the Army, to be
exact, but it is the same thing&mdash;describing what he calls
&ldquo;considerable activity&rdquo; throughout Luzon, ominously stating
that General Young (up in the Ilocano country, into which we followed
him and his cavalry in <a href="#ch12">Chapter XII</a>, <i>ante</i>)
&ldquo;has called so emphatically for more force,&rdquo; that he,
MacArthur, feels grave concern; adding that Luzon north of the Pasig is
&ldquo;very much disturbed,&rdquo; and that south of the Pasig the same
conditions prevail.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7678src" href=
"#xd27e7678" name="xd27e7678src">42</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb327" href="#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span></p>
<p>October 26th, General MacArthur cables outlining a plan for a great
campaign on comprehensive lines, stating that &ldquo;Full development
of this scheme requires about four months and all troops now in the
islands,&rdquo; and deprecating any move on Mr. Root&rsquo;s part to
reduce his force of 70,000 men by starting any of the volunteers
homeward before it should be absolutely necessary.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e7686src" href="#xd27e7686" name="xd27e7686src">43</a> October
28th, General MacArthur wires, &ldquo;Shall push everything with great
vigor,&rdquo; adding &ldquo;Expect to have everything in full operation
November 15th.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7691src" href=
"#xd27e7691" name="xd27e7691src">44</a> November 5th, as if to reassure
General MacArthur that he and the General understand each other and
that the Taft cotemporaneous nonsense is not going to be allowed to
interfere with more serious business, Secretary Root, through the
Adjutant-General, sends this cable message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Secretary of War directs no instructions from here be
allowed interfere or impede progress your military operations which he
expects you force to successful conclusion.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7699src" href="#xd27e7699" name="xd27e7699src">45</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that while the American people were being pacified with the Taft
cablegrams to Secretary Root that the Filipino people wanted peace,
General MacArthur, under Mr. Root&rsquo;s direction, was simultaneously
proceeding to <i>make</i> them want it with the customary argument used
to settle irreconcilable differences between nations&mdash;powder and
lead. Mr. Root was all the time in constant communication with both,
but he gave out only the Taft optimism to the public, and withheld the
actual facts within his knowledge. December 25th, General MacArthur
wires Secretary Root, &ldquo;Expectations based on result of election
have not been realized.&rdquo; &ldquo;Progress,&rdquo; he says, is
&ldquo;very slow.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7709src" href=
"#xd27e7709" name="xd27e7709src">46</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb328" href="#pb328" name="pb328">328</a>]</span></p>
<p>And now I come to one of the most important things that all my
researches into the official records of our government concerning the
Philippine Islands have developed. On December 28, 1900, General
MacArthur reports by cable the contents of some important insurgent
papers captured in Cavite Province about that time. The Filipinos have
a great way of reducing to writing, or making minutes of, whatever
occurs at any important conference. This habit they did not abandon in
the field. The papers in question belonged to General Trias, the
Lieutenant-General commanding all the insurgent armies in the field,
and, next to Aguinaldo, the highest official connected with the
revolutionary government. One of these papers, according to General
MacArthur&rsquo;s despatch of December 28th, purported to be the
minutes of a certain meeting had October 11th previous, between General
Trias and the Japanese Consul at Manila. As to whether or not the paper
was really authentic, General MacArthur says: &ldquo;I accept it as
such without hesitation.&rdquo; Communicating the contents of the paper
he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Consul advised that Trias visit Japan. Filipinos
represented that concessions which they might be forced to make to
Washington would be more agreeable if made to Japan, <i>which as a
nation of kindred blood would not be likely to assert superiority</i>.
Consul said Japan desired coaling station, freedom to trade and build
railways.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7723src" href="#xd27e7723" name=
"xd27e7723src">47</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I consider these negotiations of the Japanese Government with the
Philippine insurgents important to be related here because they have
never been generally known, for the good reason, of course, that the
President of the United States cannot take the public into his
confidence about such grave and delicate matters when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span>they
occur. The incident is not &ldquo;ancient history&rdquo; relatively to
present-day problems, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Because it is credibly reported and currently believed in the
United States that in Japan, during the cruise of our battleship fleet
around the world in 1907, one of the reception committee of Japanese
officers who welcomed our officers was recognized by one of the latter
as having been, not a great while before that, a servant aboard an
American battleship.</p>
<p>(2) Because of the following incident, related to me, in 1911,
without the slightest injunction of secrecy, by the Director of Public
Health of the Philippine Islands, then on a visit to the United States.
Shortly before the Director&rsquo;s said visit home, while he was out
in one of the provinces, there was brought to his attention a Filipino
with a broken arm. There was a Japanese doctor in the town, at least a
Japanese who had a sign out as a doctor. The Director carried the
sufferer to the &ldquo;doctor,&rdquo; not being a surgeon himself. The
&ldquo;doctor&rdquo; turned out to be a civil engineer, who had been
making maps and plans of fortifications. The plans were found in his
possession.</p>
<p>(3) Because from one of the islands through which the northern line
of the Treaty of Paris runs, situated only a pleasant morning&rsquo;s
journey in a launch due north of Aparri, the northernmost town of
Luzon, you can see, on a clear day, with a good field-glass, the
southern end of Formosa, some 60 or 70 miles away. <i>Japan can land an
army on American soil at Aparri any time she wants to,
overnight</i>&mdash;an army several times that of the total American
force now in the Philippines,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7743src" href=
"#xd27e7743" name="xd27e7743src">48</a> or likely ever to be there.
From Aparri it is 70 miles up the river to Tueguegarao, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span>40
more to Iligan, and 90 more, all fairly good marching, to Bayombong, in
Nueva Viscaya (total distance, Aparri to Bayombong, 200 miles) the
province which lies in the heart of the watershed of Central Luzon. I
know what I am talking about, because that region was the first
judicial district I presided over, and many a hard journey I have had
over it, circuit riding, on a scrubby pony. Part of it I have been
through in the company of President Taft. It thus appears that from
Aparri to Bayombong there would be but a week or ten days of unresisted
marching to reach the watershed region, Nueva Viscaya. The Japanese
soldier&rsquo;s ration is mainly rice, so that he can carry more
days&rsquo; travel rations than almost any other soldier in the world.
Never fear about their making the journey inside of a week or ten days,
once they start. To descend from the watershed aforesaid, over the
Caranglan Pass, and down the valley of the Rio Grande de Pampanga to
Manila, another three or four days would be all that would be needed.
It would be a Japanese picnic. Fortifying Corregidor Island, at the
entrance to Manila Bay, which is about all the serious scheme of
defence against a foreign foe we have out there, is quite like the
reliance of the Spaniards on Morro Castle, at the mouth of the harbor
of Santiago de Cuba, against our landing at Guantanamo. Our garrison in
the Philippines, all told, is but a handful. Aparri is an absolutely
unfortified seaport, at which the Japanese could land an army overnight
from the southern end of Formosa. There are no military fortifications
whatsoever to stay the advance of an invading army from Aparri down the
Cagayan Valley, and thence over the watershed of Nueva Viscaya
Province, through the Caranglan Pass, and down the valley of the
Pampanga River to Manila. So that to-day Japan can take Manila inside
of two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>weeks any time she wants to. That is why I
object to the President&rsquo;s &ldquo;jollying&rdquo; the situation
along as best he can, without taking the American people into his
confidence. Any army officer at our War College will inform any member
of the House or Senate on inquiry, that Japan can take the Philippines
any time she wants to. President Taft and the Mikado may keep on
exchanging the most cordial cablegrams imaginable, but the map-making
goes on just the same. And, earnest and sincere as both the President
and the Emperor undoubtedly are in their desire to preserve the general
peace, who is going to restrain Hobson and Hearst, and several of
Japan&rsquo;s public men equally distinguished and equally
inflammatory? Heads of nations cannot restrain gusts of popular
passion. The Pacific Coast is not so friendly to Japan as the rest of
our country, and as between Japan and the Pacific Coast, we are pretty
apt to stand by the latter without inquiring with meticulous nicety
into any differences that may arise.</p>
<p>The reason I said in the chapter before this one that Mr. Root is a
dangerous man to Republican institutions was because he is of the type
who are constantly finding situations which they consider it best for
the people not to know about. After the McKinley election of 1900 was
safely &ldquo;put over,&rdquo; Mr. Root, as Secretary of War, let Judge
Taft go ahead and ride his dove-of-peace hobby-horse in the
Philippines, duly repeating to the American people all the cheery Taft
cluckings to said horse, at a time when the real situation is indicated
by such grim correspondence as the following cablegram dated January
29, 1901:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Wood, Havana: Secretary of War is desirous to know if
you can give your consent to the immediate withdrawal <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span>Tenth Infantry from Cuba. <i>Imperative that we
have immediate use of every available company we can lay our hands on
for service in the Philippines.</i> (Signed) Corbin.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e7760src" href="#xd27e7760" name="xd27e7760src">49</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But let us turn from this sorry spectacle of Mr. Root pulling the
wool over the eyes of his countrymen to make them believe the Filipinos
were not quite so unconsenting as they seemed to be, and again look at
the sheer splendor of American military ability to get anything done
the Government wants done. I refer to the capture of Aguinaldo.</p>
<p>One of the most eminent lawyers in this country once said to me,
&ldquo;I would not let that man Funston enter my house.&rdquo; I tried
to enlighten him, but as I happened to be a guest in his house at the
time, which entitled him to exemption from light if he
insisted&mdash;which he did&mdash;General Funston and he have continued
to miss what might have been a real pleasure to them both. The
following is, as briefly as I can dispose of it, the story of the
capture of Aguinaldo on March 23, 1901.</p>
<p>Ever since Aguinaldo had escaped through our lines in November,
1899, his capture had been the one great consummation most devoutly
wished. It has already been shown how busy with the war the army was
all the time Judge Taft was gayly jogging away astride of his peace
hobby about the insurrection being really quite regretted and over.
However, in the favorite remark with which he used to wave the
insurrection into thin air, to the effect that it was now merely
&ldquo;a Mafia on a large scale,&rdquo; there was one element of truth.
The general feeling of the people, both educated and uneducated, was
such as to countenance the attitude of the leaders that pro-American
tendencies were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333"
name="pb333">333</a>]</span>treason. Any leader who surrendered of
course was thereafter an object of at least some suspicion to his
fellow-countrymen, however assiduous his subsequent double-dealing. As
long as Aguinaldo remained out, this state of affairs was sure to
continue indefinitely, possibly for years to come. If captured,
<i>he</i> would probably himself give up the struggle, and use his
influence with the rest to do likewise. Therefore, in the spring of
1901, each and every one of General MacArthur&rsquo;s 70,000 men was,
and had been since 1899, on the <i>qui vive</i> to make his own
personal fortunes secure for life, and gain lasting military
distinction, by taking any sort of chances to capture Aguinaldo. On
February 8, 1901, an officer of General Funston&rsquo;s district, the
Fourth, in central Luzon, intercepted a messenger bearing despatches
from Aguinaldo to one of his generals of that region, directing the
general (Lacuna) to send some reinforcements to him, Aguinaldo. General
Funston&rsquo;s headquarters were then at San Fernando, in the province
of Pampanga&mdash;organized as a &ldquo;civil&rdquo; government
province by act of the Taft Commission just five days later.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e7779src" href="#xd27e7779" name=
"xd27e7779src">50</a> Through these despatches and their bearer,
General Funston ascertained the hiding-place of the insurgent chieftain
to be at a place called Palanan, in the mountains of Isabela Province,
in northeastern Luzon, near the Pacific Coast. Early in the war we had
availed ourselves of a certain tribe, or clan, known as the Maccabebes,
who look nowise different from all other Filipinos, but who had, under
the Spanish government, by reason of long-standing feuds with their
more rebellious neighbors, come to be absolutely loyal to the Spanish
authorities. When we came they had transferred that loyalty to us, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span>had now become a recognized and valuable part of
our military force. So it occurred to General Funston; &ldquo;Why not
personate the reinforcements called for, the American officers to
command the expedition assuming the r&ocirc;le of captured American
prisoners?&rdquo; The plan was submitted to General MacArthur and
adopted. A picked company of Maccabebes was selected, consisting of
about eighty men, and General Funston decided to go himself, taking
with him on the perilous expedition four young officers of proven
mettle: Captain Harry W. Newton, 34th Infantry, U. S. Volunteers, now a
captain of the Coast Artillery; Captain R. T. Hazzard, 11th Volunteer
Cavalry; Lieutenant O. P. M. Hazzard, his brother, of the same
regiment, the latter now an officer of the regular army, and Lieutenant
Mitchell, &ldquo;my efficient aid.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7788src" href="#xd27e7788" name="xd27e7788src">51</a> March 6,
1901, the U.S.S. <i>Vicksburg</i> slipped <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e7797" title="Source: quitely">quietly</span> out of Manila Bay,
bearing the participants in the desperate enterprise&mdash;as desperate
an undertaking as the heart and brain of a soldier ever carried to a
successful conclusion. General Thomas H. Barry wrote Secretary of War
Root, after they left, telling of their departure, and stating that he
did not much expect ever to see them again. The chances were ten to one
that the eighty men would meet five or ten times their number, and, as
they were to masquerade as troops of the enemy, they could not
complain, under the recognized laws of war as to spies, at being
summarily shot if captured alive. And the whole Filipino people were a
secret service ready to warn Aguinaldo, should the carefully concocted
ruse be discovered anywhere along the journey. They went down to the
southern end of Luzon, and through the San Bernardino Straits into the
Pacific Ocean, and thence up the east coast of Luzon to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=
"pb335">335</a>]</span>Casiguran Bay, about 100 miles south of Palanan,
landing at Casiguran Bay, March 14th. The &ldquo;little Macks,&rdquo;
as General Funston calls the Maccabebes, were made to discard their
dapper American uniforms after they got aboard the ship, and don
instead a lot of nondescript clothing gathered by the military
authorities at Manila before the <i>Vicksburg</i> sailed, so as to
resemble the average insurgent command. Not a man of them had been told
of the nature of the expedition before sailing. This was not for fear
of treachery, but lest some one of the faithful &ldquo;Macks&rdquo;
should get his tongue loosed by hospitality before departing. Also,
their Krag-Jorgensen regulation rifles were taken from them, and a
miscellaneous assortment of old Springfields, Mausers, etc., given them
instead, to complete the deception. An ex-insurgent officer, well known
to Aguinaldo, but now in General Funston&rsquo;s employ, was to play
the r&ocirc;le of commanding officer of the
&ldquo;reinforcements.&rdquo; To read General Funston&rsquo;s account
of this expedition is a more convincing rebuttal of the contemporaneous
Taft denials of Filipino hostility and of the unanimity of the feeling
of the people against us, than a thousand quotations from official
documents could ever be. It was necessary to land more than 100 miles
south of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s hiding-place, lest the smoke of the
approaching vessel should be sighted from a distance, and some peasant
or lookout give the alarm. Accordingly, they landed at Casiguran Bay by
night, with the ship&rsquo;s lights screened, the <i>Vicksburg</i> at
once departing out of sight of land, and agreeing to meet them off
Palanan, their destination, on March 25th, eleven days later. From the
beginning they vigilantly and consummately played the r&ocirc;le
planned, the &ldquo;Macks&rdquo; having been drilled on the way up,
each and all, in the story they were to tell at the first village
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=
"pb336">336</a>]</span>near Casiguran Bay, and everywhere thereafter,
to the effect that they had come across country, and en route had met
ten American soldiers out map-making, and had killed two, wounded
three, and captured five. They were to point to General Funston and the
four other Americans in corroboration of their story. Speaking of
himself and his four fellow &ldquo;prisoners,&rdquo; General Funston
says, &ldquo;We were a pretty scrubby looking lot of privates.&rdquo;
The villagers received the patriot forces, thus flushed with triumph,
in an appropriate manner, and supplied them with rations and guides for
the rest of their 100-mile journey to the headquarters of the
&ldquo;dictator.&rdquo; General Funston is even at pains to say for the
village officials that they were very humane and courteous to himself
and the other four American &ldquo;prisoners.&rdquo; They reached
Palanan Bay, eight miles from Palanan, on March 22d. Here Hilario Tal
Placido, the ex-insurgent officer whose r&ocirc;le in the present
thrilling drama was that of &ldquo;commanding officer&rdquo; of the
expedition, sent a note to Aguinaldo, stating that he had halted his
command for a rest at the beach preparatory to marching inland and
reporting to the Honorable Presidente, that they were very much
exhausted, and much in need of food, and please to send him some. Of
course that was the natural card to play to put Aguinaldo off his
guard. The food came, and the bearers returned and casually reported to
the Honorable Presidente that his honorable reinforcements would soon
be along, much to the honorable joy&mdash;to make the thing a little
Japanesque&mdash;of the president of the honorable republic. This
incident has been since made the occasion of some criticism&mdash;that
it was contrary to decency to accept Aguinaldo&rsquo;s food and then
attack him afterwards. General Funston very properly replies in effect
that the case would have been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337"
href="#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span>very different had he thrown
himself on Aguinaldo&rsquo;s mercy, taken his food, and used treachery
afterwards, but that his conduct was entirely correct, under the code
of war, for the reason that should he and his command be captured while
personating enemy&rsquo;s forces, Aguinaldo would have had a perfect
right, under the rules of the game, to shoot them all as spies. He adds
rather savagely, concerning &ldquo;certain ladylike persons in the
United States&rdquo; who have censured his course in the matter, that
he &ldquo;would be <i>very much interested in seeing</i> the results of
a surgical operation performed on the skull of a man who cannot readily
see the radical difference between the two propositions,&rdquo; and
that he doubts if a good quality of calf brains would be revealed by
the operation.</p>
<p>At all events, the expedition was very much refreshed by the food
and highly delighted at the proof, contained in the sending of it, that
Aguinaldo did not suspect a ruse. But now came one of the many
emergencies which had to be met by quick wit in the course of that
memorable adventure. Aguinaldo sent word to leave the
&ldquo;prisoners&rdquo; under a guard in one of the huts by the
sea-shore, where there was one of the Aguinaldo retainers in charge, an
old Tagalo. After a hurried, whispered conversation,
&ldquo;prisoner&rdquo; Funston instructed &ldquo;Commanding
Officer&rdquo; Placido to go ahead with his main column and then a
little later send back a forged written order purporting to be from
Aguinaldo, for the &ldquo;prisoners&rdquo; to come on also. This was
shown to the old Tagalo, thus disarming suspicion on his part. But now
came the &ldquo;closest shave&rdquo; they had. The column met a
detachment from Aguinaldo&rsquo;s headquarters sent down with
instructions to relieve the necessarily worn-out guard of the newly
arrived &ldquo;re-inforcements&rdquo; that were supposed to be guarding
the five prisoners at the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href=
"#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span>beach, and let said guard come on
up to headquarters with the rest of the &ldquo;re-inforcements,&rdquo;
the idea being to still leave the prisoners at the beach so they would
not learn definitely as to the Aguinaldo whereabouts. Detaining the
officer commanding this detachment for a moment or so on some pretext,
the &ldquo;Commanding Officer&rdquo; of the
&ldquo;re-inforcements&rdquo; whispered to a Maccabebe corporal to run
back and tell General Funston and the rest of the
&ldquo;prisoners&rdquo; to jump in the bushes and hide. This they did,
lying within thirty feet of the detachment, as it passed them en route
for the beach. Of course a fight would have meant considerable firing,
and the quarry might hear it, take fright, and escape. Finally they
reached Palanan, the &ldquo;prisoners&rdquo; quite far in the rear.
Placido got safely into Aguinaldo&rsquo;s presence, followed at a short
distance by the main body of his Maccabebes. Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
life-guard of some fifty men, neatly uniformed, presented arms as
Placido entered the insurgent headquarters building, and thereafter
waited at attention outside. Then the worthy Placido entertained the
honorable Presidente with a few cock-and-bull stories about the march
across country, etc., made obediently to the President&rsquo;s order,
keeping a weather eye out of the window all the time. As soon as the
Maccabebes had come up and formed facing the Aguinaldo life-guard,
Placido went to the window and ordered them to open fire. This they
did, killing two of the insurgents and wounding their commanding
officer. The rest fled, panic-stricken, by reason of the surprise. Then
Placido, a very stout individual, grabbed Aguinaldo, who only weighs
about 115 pounds, threw him down, and <i>sat on him</i>, until General
Funston, the Hazzards, Mitchell, and Newton arrived. The orders were
iron-clad that under no circumstances, if it could be avoided, was
Aguinaldo to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span>be killed. His signature to proclamations
telling the people to quit the war was going to be needed too much. The
party rested two days and then set out for the coast again, on March
25th, the day the <i>Vicksburg</i> had agreed to meet them. &ldquo;At
noon&rdquo; says General Funston, &ldquo;we again saw the Pacific, and
far out on it a wisp of smoke&mdash;the <i>Vicksburg</i> coming
in!&rdquo; In due course they reached Manila Bay. The old palace of the
Spanish captains-general, then occupied by our commanding general, is
up the Pasig River, accessible from the bay by launch. By that method
General Funston took his precious prisoner to the palace without the
knowledge of a soul in the great city of Manila. He arrived before
General MacArthur had gotten up. In a few minutes the General came out.
&ldquo;Where is Aguinaldo?&rdquo; said he, dryly. He supposed General
Funston simply had some details to tell, like the commanding officers
of hundreds of other expeditions that had gone out before that on false
scents in search of the illustrious but elusive Presidente.
&ldquo;Right here in this house,&rdquo; said General Funston. General
MacArthur could hardly believe his ears. A few days later, General
Funston walked into General MacArthur&rsquo;s office. The latter said;
&ldquo;Well, Funston, they do not seem to have thought much in
Washington of your performance. I am afraid you have got into
trouble.&rdquo; &ldquo;At the same time he handed me,&rdquo; says
General Funston in the <i>Scribner Magazine</i> article above
mentioned, &ldquo;a cablegram announcing my appointment as a
brigadier-general in the regular army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his annual report for 1901,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7837src"
href="#xd27e7837" name="xd27e7837src">52</a> General MacArthur
describes the capture of Aguinaldo as &ldquo;the most momentous single
event of the year,&rdquo; stating also that &ldquo;Aguinaldo was the
incarnation of the insurrection.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb340" href="#pb340" name="pb340">340</a>]</span>This last statement
explains why he was so anxious to capture him <i>alive</i>. If dead, he
would be sure to get <i>re-incarnated</i> in the person of some able
assistant of his entourage, thus insuring undisturbed continuance of
the war. He was most graciously treated by General MacArthur during his
stay as that distinguished soldier&rsquo;s &ldquo;guest&rdquo; at the
<span class="corr" id="xd27e7852" title=
"Source: Malacanan">Malaca&ntilde;an</span> palace, from March 28th
until April 20th. The word &ldquo;guest&rdquo; is placed in quotations
because the host thought so much of him that he considered him worth
many hundred times his weight in gold, and had him watched <i>night and
day by a commissioned officer</i>. Everything that had been done by the
Americans since November, 1899, was explained to him, and he was made
to see that our purposes with regard to his people were not only
benevolent but also inflexible; in other words that there was no
altering our determination to make his people happy whether they were
willing or not. Seeing this, Aguinaldo bowed to the inevitable. The
programme explained to Aguinaldo is wittily described by a very bright
Englishwoman as a plan &ldquo;to have lots of American school teachers
at once set to work to teach the Filipino English and at the same time
keep plenty of American soldiers around to knock him on the head should
he get a notion that he is ready for self-government before the
Americans think he is&rdquo;&mdash;a quaint scheme, she adds,
&ldquo;and one characteristic of the dauntlessness of American
energy.&rdquo; To be brief, on April 19th, Aguinaldo took the oath of
allegiance to the American Government, which all agree he has
faithfully observed ever since, and issued a proclamation recommending
abandonment of further resistance. This proclamation was at once
published by General MacArthur and signalized by the immediate
liberation of one thousand prisoners of war, on their likewise
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name=
"pb341">341</a>]</span>taking the oath of allegiance. In his
proclamation Aguinaldo said, among other things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The time has come, however, when they [the Filipino
people] find their advance along this path [the path of their
aspirations] impeded by an irresistible force. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Enough
of blood, enough of tears and desolation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He concludes by announcing his final unconditional submission to
American sovereignty and advises others to do likewise.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e7867src" href="#xd27e7867" name=
"xd27e7867src">53</a></p>
<p>Soon after this General Ti&ntilde;o surrendered in General
Young&rsquo;s district, and in another part of northern Luzon, General
Mascardo, commanding the insurgent forces in the provinces of Bataan
and Zambales, heretofore described as &ldquo;the west wing of the great
central plain,&rdquo; also surrendered. In the latter part of June,
General Cailles, with whom we have already had occasion to become
acquainted, in connection with Judge Taft&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mafia on a
large scale,&rdquo; also surrendered in Laguna Province. After that,
there was never any more trouble in northern Luzon. But during the
spring of 1901, the Commission had been very busy organizing the
provinces of southern Luzon under civil government, thus cutting short
the process of licking it into submission and substituting a process of
loving it into that state through good salaries and otherwise&mdash;a
policy which postponed the final permanent pacification of that
ill-fated region for several years, as hereinafter more fully set
forth.</p>
<p>The unconditional absoluteness with which Judge Taft acted from the
beginning on the assumption that the Filipinos would make a distinction
between civil and military rule, and that their objection to us was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>because we had first sent soldiers to rule them
and not civilians, and that these objections would vanish before the
benignant sunlight of a government by civilians, is one of the great
tragedies of all history, considering the countless lives it eventually
cost. As a matter of fact, the Filipino objection had little or no
relation to the kind of clothes we wore, whether they were white duck
or khaki. Their objection was to <i>us, i.e.</i>, to an alien yoke.
However, to heal the bleeding wounds of war, the Filipinos were
benevolently told to forget it, and a civil government was set up on
July 4, 1901, pursuant to the amiable delusion indicated. That it has
never yet proved a panacea, and why, will be developed in the next and
subsequent chapters, but only in-so-far as such development throws
light on the present situation&mdash;which it is the whole object of
this book to do.</p>
<p>And now a few words by way of concluding the present chapter, as
preliminary to the inauguration of a civil government, cannot be
misconstrued, though they come from one who held office under it. I
have certainly made clear that Judge Taft and his colleagues were as
honest in their delusion about how popular they were with the Filipinos
as many other public men who have been known to have hobbies, and my
remarks must be understood as based on the comprehensive
bird&rsquo;s-eye view which we have had of the whole situation from the
outbreak of the war with Spain in 1898 to the end of June, 1901, as a
summation of that situation. It is quite true that all contemporary
history is as much affected by its environment as the writer of it is
by his own limitations. But it certainly seems clear now that, in
regard to the Philippine problem presented in 1898 by the decision to
keep the islands, the American people were played upon by the
politicians <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name=
"pb343">343</a>]</span>for the next few years thereafter, sometimes on
the idea that the Filipino people were <i>not</i> a people but only a
jumble of semi-civilized tribes incapable of any intelligent notion of
what independence meant, and sometimes on the idea that while there was
no denying that they <i>were</i> indeed a civilized, homogeneous,
Christian people, yet the great majority of them did not want
independence, and would prefer to be under a strong alien government.
But the key-note to the McKinley policy from the beginning, his answer
to the eager question of his own people, was that there was no real
absence of the consent of the governed. In Senator Lodge&rsquo;s
history of the war with Spain, written in 1899, there is a description
of the long struggle for independence in Cuba, whose existence Spain
denied year after year until we decided that patience had ceased to be
a virtue, which description is so strikingly applicable to the
situation in the Philippines during the first years of American rule
that I cannot refrain from quoting it here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">And we were to go on pretending that the war was not
there, and that we had answered the unsettled question, when we really
had simply turned our heads aside and refused to look. And then when
the troublesome matter had been so nicely laid to sleep, the result
followed which is usual <i>when Congressmen and Presidents and nations
are trying to make shams pass for realities</i>.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e7899src" href="#xd27e7899" name=
"xd27e7899src">54</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the same high token the Philippine question will always remain
&ldquo;the unsettled question&rdquo; until it is settled right. In
other words, the American occupation of the Philippines, having been
originally predicated on the idea that the Filipino people did not
really want independence, a fiction which political expediency
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name=
"pb344">344</a>]</span>incident to government by parties inexorably
compelled it to try to live up to thereafter, took the form, in 1901,
of a civil government founded upon a benevolent lie, which expressed a
hope, not a fact, a hopeless hope that can never be a fact. And that is
what has been the matter with it ever since.</p>

this MacArthur, October 1, 1900, statement with the Taft statements of
the same situation between June and November, 1900, as expressed for
instance in his November, 1900, report to the Secretary of War thus:
&ldquo;<i>A great majority of the people long for peace and are
entirely willing to accept the establishment of a government under the
supremacy of the United States.</i> They are, however, restrained by
fear. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Without this, armed resistance to the United
States authority would have long ago ceased. It is a Mafia on a very
large scale.&rdquo; Report, Taft Commission, November 30, 1900, p. 17.
This was before Judge Taft met Juan Cailles above mentioned and liked
him well enough to make him governor of a province, in spite of his
being an &ldquo;assassin,&rdquo; in other words a Filipino general who
had a few weak-kneed fellows shot for being too friendly with the
Americans.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd27e7566src">&uarr;</a></p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On February 22, 1898, the American Consul at Manila,
Mr. Williams, after he had been at that post for about a month, wrote
the State Department, describing the Spanish methods of keeping from
the world the outward and visible manifestations of the desire of the
Filipino people to be free from their yoke thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Peace was proclaimed and, since my coming, festivities
therefor were held; but there is no peace, and has been none for two
years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Conditions here and in Cuba are practically alike. War
exists, battles are of almost daily occurrence, etc.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e7937src" href="#xd27e7937" name="xd27e7937src">1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As will hereinafter appear, this is not far from a correct
description of the conditions which prevailed successively in various
provinces of the Philippines in gradually lessening degree for the six
years next ensuing after the report of the Taft Commission of November
30, 1900, wherein they said: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href=
"#pb346" name="pb346">346</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">A great majority of the people long for peace and are

supremacy of the United States.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7949src"
href="#xd27e7949" name="xd27e7949src">2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have seen how from the date of the outbreak, February 4, 1899, to
the date of his final departure from the islands for the United States
on May 5, 1900, General Otis had diligently supplied the eager ear of
Mr. McKinley with his &ldquo;situation well in hand&rdquo; and
&ldquo;insurrection about to collapse&rdquo; telegrams, Secretary of
War Alger having meantime been forced out of the cabinet&mdash;in part,
at least&mdash;by a public opinion which indignantly believed that the
real situation was being withheld. We have seen how, from soon after
the arrival of the Taft Commission at Manila on June 3, 1900, until
after the November elections of that year, the same eager presidential
ear aforesaid was supplied with like material through the presumably
innocent but opportunely deluded optimism of the Commission, as
manifested in the above sample message; how the actual military
situation as described by General MacArthur, the military commander at
the time, was one of &ldquo;desperate resistance by means of a general
banding of the people in support of the guerrillas in the
field,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e7957src" href="#xd27e7957"
name="xd27e7957src">3</a> he having wired the War Department on January
4, 1901, &ldquo;Troops throughout the archipelago more active than at
any time since November, 1899&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e7963src" href="#xd27e7963" name="xd27e7963src">4</a> and how this
had been followed on July 4, 1901, by a civil government, the
inauguration of which could by no possibility be construed as affirming
to the people of the United States anything other than the existence of
a state of peace. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347"
name="pb347">347</a>]</span></p>
<p>We are to trace in this and subsequent chapters how, a short time
after the civil government was instituted, the insurrection got its
second wind; how a year later came another public declaration of peace,
on July 4, 1902; and how this was followed by a long series of public
disorders, combated by prosecutions for sedition and brigandage, until
toward the end of 1906. The drama is quite an allegory&mdash;Uncle Sam
wrestling with his guardian angel Consent-of-the-governed. He finally
gets both the angel&rsquo;s shoulders on the mat, however, and so the
two have lived at loggerheads in the Philippines ever since.</p>
<p>As soon as we had once blundered into the colonial business, the
rock-bottom frankness with which we so dearly love to deal with one
another, let carping Europe deny it as she will, was superseded by a
systematic effort on the part of the statesmen responsible for the
blunder to conceal it. It soon became clear to those on the inside that
the sovereign American people had &ldquo;bought a gold brick,&rdquo;
that is to say, had made a grievous mistake and had <i>done wrong</i>.
But as it is not expedient for courtiers to tell the sovereign he has
done wrong, because &ldquo;The king can do no wrong,&rdquo; thereafter
all the courtiers,&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> persons desiring to control the
&ldquo;sovereign&rdquo; while seeming to obey him&mdash;instead of
risking loss of the &ldquo;royal&rdquo; favor by boldly telling the
people they had done wrong and ought to mend the error of their ways,
began to fill their ears and salve their conscience with medi&aelig;val
doctrines about salvation of the heathen through governmental missions
maintained by the joint agencies of Cross and Sword. For the foregoing
and cognate reasons, Senator Lodge&rsquo;s description of Spain&rsquo;s
last thirty years in Cuba fits our first six or seven in the
Philippines, beginning in 1899 with the original Otis press censorship
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span>policy of &ldquo;not letting anything go that
will hurt the Administration,&rdquo; and coming on down to a
certificate made in 1907 by the Philippine Commission for consumption
in the United States, to the effect that a state of general and
complete peace had prevailed throughout the islands for a stated period
preceding the certificate, when, as a matter of fact, during the period
covered by the certificate, an executive proclamation formally
declaring a state of insurrection had issued, and the Supreme Court of
the islands had upheld certain drastic executive action as legal
<i>because</i> of the state of insurrection recognized by the
proclamation.</p>
<p>The Taft civil government of the Philippines set up in 1901 was an
attempt to answer the question which, during the crucial period of our
country&rsquo;s history following the Spanish War, rang so persistently
through the public utterances of both Grover Cleveland and Benjamin
Harrison: &ldquo;Mr. President, how are you going to square the
subjugation of the Philippines with the freeing of Cuba?&rdquo; Mr.
McKinley&rsquo;s answer had been, in effect: &ldquo;Never mind about
that, Grover; you and Benjamin are back numbers. I will show you
&lsquo;the latest thing&rsquo; in the consent-of-the-governed line, a
government <i>not</i> &lsquo;essentially popular,&rsquo; it is true,
nor indeed at all &lsquo;popular,&rsquo; in fact very unpopular, but
&lsquo;essentially popular <i>in form</i>.&rsquo; You lads are not
experts on the political trapeze.&rdquo; Accordingly, as Senator Lodge
said concerning the dreary years of continuous public disorders in Cuba
under Spain, which we finally put a stop to in 1898:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We were to go on pretending that the war was not
there, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lack of frankness is usually due to weakness of one sort or another.
The weakness of the Spanish colonial <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb349" href="#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span>system lay in the
impotent poverty of the home government and the graft tendencies of the
colonial officials. The weakness of the American colonial system has
always lain in the fundamental unfitness of republican governmental
machinery for boldly advocating and honestly enforcing doctrines which
deny frankly and as a matter of course that governments derive their
just powers from the consent of the governed. There are so many people
in a republic like ours who will always stand by this last proposition
as righteous, and as being the chief bulwark of their own liberties,
and so many who will always regard denial of that proposition as an
insidious practice calculated ultimately to react on their own
institutions, that no colonial government of conquered subject
provinces eager for independence can ever have the sympathy and backing
of all our people. Thus it is that to get home support for the policy,
the supreme need of the colonial government is constant apology for its
own existence, and constant effort to show that the subject people do
not really want freedom to pursue happiness in their own way as badly
as their orators say they do; that the oratory is mere &ldquo;hot
air&rdquo;; and that the people really like alien domination better
than they seem to.</p>
<p>Always in a mental attitude of self-defence against home criticism,
in its official reports there is ever present with the Philippine
insular government the tendency and temptation not to volunteer to the
American people evidence within its possession calculated to awaken
discussion as to the wisdom of its continuance. It thus usurps a
legitimate function never intended to be delegated to the Executive,
but reserved to the people. It thus makes itself the judge of how much
the people at home shall know. The law of self-preservation prompts it
not to take the American <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href=
"#pb350" name="pb350">350</a>]</span>people into its confidence, at
least not that portion of them who are opposed on principle to holding
remote colonies impossible to defend in the event of war without a
large standing army maintained for the purpose. There is always the
apprehension that the value of apparently unfavorable evidence will not
be wisely weighed by the people at home, because of unfamiliarity with
insular conditions. This is by no means altogether vicious. It is a
perfectly natural attitude and a good deal can be said in favor of it.
But the real vice of it lies in the fact that your colonial government
thus becomes not unlike the president of a certain naval board before
which a case involving the commission of an officer of the navy was
once tried. They had no competent official stenographer to take down
all that transpired. The Navy Department was asked for one, but they
referred it to the board. The president of the board knew very well
that &ldquo;the defence&rdquo; wanted to show bias on his part. He
exuded conscious rectitude and plainly resented any suggestion of bias.
So a stenographer was refused and the case proceeded, the proceedings
being recorded in long hand by a regular permanent employee of the
board. Under such circumstances, there is so much which transpires that
is absolutely irrelevant and immaterial, that the proceedings would be
interminable if every little thing were recorded. Consequently, much
that <i>was</i> material, including casual remarks of the president of
the board clearly indicative of bias sufficient to disqualify any judge
or juror on earth, failed of entry in the record. However, enough was
gotten into the record to satisfy the President of the United States
that the president of the board was not only not impartial, but very
much prejudiced, and he reversed the action of the board. The case of
that board is very much like the case of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name=
"pb351">351</a>]</span>Philippine Government. The case of the latter
is, as it were, a case involving a question as to how long a
guardianship ought to continue, and they simply fail and omit to have
recorded in a form where it may be available to the reviewing
authority, the American people, much that is material (on the idea of
saving the reviewing authority labor and trouble), which they think the
record ought not to be cumbered with, or the reviewing authority
bothered with. This practice is due to a confident belief that the
American people, being so far away, and being necessarily so wholly
unacquainted with all the ins and outs of the situation in the
Philippines, are not fitted to pass intelligently on the questions
which continually confront the colonial government. This is not a
mental attitude of insult to the intelligence of the people of the
United States. It is simply a belief that they, the colonial officials,
know much better than the American people can ever know, what is
wisest, in each case, to be done in the premises. And there is much to
be said in favor of this view, so far as details go. The fundamental
error of it, however, lies in the assumption that the American people
are forever committed to permanent retention of the Philippines, <i>i.
e.</i>, permanent so far as any living human being is
concerned&mdash;an assumption wholly unauthorized by any declaration of
the law-making power of this government, and countenanced only by the
oft-expressed hope of President Taft that that will be the policy some
day declared, if any definite policy is ever declared. Thus it is that
throughout the last twelve years those particular facts and events
which (to me) seem most vitally relevant to the fundamental question in
the case, viz., whether or not we should continue to persist in the
original blunder of inaugurating and maintaining a&mdash;to all intents
and purposes&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352"
name="pb352">352</a>]</span>permanent over-seas colonial government,
have been withheld from the knowledge of the American public. The
present policy of indefinite retention with undeclared intention is a
mere makeshift to avoid a frank avowal of intention to retain the
islands for all future time with which anybody living has any practical
concern. Until it is substituted by a definite declaration by Congress
similar to the one we made in the case of Cuba, and the present
American Governor-General and his associates are substituted by men
sent out to report back how soon they think the Filipinos may safely be
trusted to attend to their own domestic concerns, all crucial facts and
situations that might jeopardize the continuance of the present
American r&eacute;gime in the Philippines will continue, as heretofore,
to remain unmentioned in the official reports of the American
authorities now out there. Until that is done, you will never hear the
Filipino side of the case from anybody whose opinion you are willing to
make the basis of governmental action. These remarks will, obviously
from the nature of the case, be quite as true long after President
Taft, the reader, and I are dead as they are now.</p>
<p>Mr. Taft would be very glad to have Congress declare frankly that it
is the purpose of this Government to hold the Philippines permanently,
<i>i. e.</i>, permanently so far as the word means continuance of the
&ldquo;uplift&rdquo; treatment long after everybody now on the earth is
beneath it. But because public opinion in the United States is so much
divided as to the wisdom of a policy of frankly avowed intention
permanently to retain the islands, he prefers to leave the whole matter
open and undetermined, so as to get the support both of those who think
a definite programme of permanent retention righteous and those who
think such a programme vicious. He wishes to please both sides of a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name=
"pb353">353</a>]</span>moral issue, on the idea that, as the present
policy is in his individual judgment best for all concerned, the end
justifies the means. Yet, as the issue <i>is</i> a moral one, which
concerns the cause of representative government throughout the world,
and a strategic one which concerns the national defence, it should, in
my judgment, no longer be dodged, but squarely met. You constantly hear
President Taft talking quite out loud here at home, in his public
utterances, about the great politico-missionary work we are doing in
the Philippines by furnishing them with the most approved up-to-date
methods for the pursuit of happiness, the avoidance of graft in
government, the elimination of crimes of violence, in short the ideal
way to minimize the ills that human governments are heir to, while
every day and every dollar spent out there by Americans induced by him
to go there, are time and money tensely arrayed against the ultimate
independence he purports to favor. Give the Americans out there a
square deal. Let them know whether we are going to keep the islands or
whether we are not. Honesty is a far better policy than the present
policy. The Americans in the islands, Mr. Taft&rsquo;s agents in the
Philippines, talk no uncandid and misleading stuff about the
Philippines being exclusively for the Filipinos. And they do
considerable talking. They need looking after, if the present pious
fiction is to be kept up at this end of the line. Nobody in the
Philippines to-day, among the Americans, considers talk about
independence as anything other than political buncombe very hampering
to their work. Listen to this high official of the insular government,
who writes in the <i>North American Review</i> for February, 1912:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The somewhat blatant note with which we at the
beginning proclaimed our altruistic purposes in the Philippines
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name=
"pb354">354</a>]</span>has <i>died away into a whisper</i>. <i>To say
much about it is to incur a charge of hypocrisy.</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd27e8038src" href="#xd27e8038" name="xd27e8038src">5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most important problem which confronted Mr. McKinley when he
sent Judge Taft to the Philippines was how to so handle the supreme
question of public order as to avoid any necessity of having to ask
Congress later for more volunteers to replace those whose terms of
enlistment would expire June 30, 1901. We have already reviewed the
strenuous efforts of General MacArthur during the twelve months
immediately following the arrival of the Taft Commission in June, 1900,
to get rid of the shadow of this necessity by the date named, the
regular army having been reorganized meantime and considerably
increased by the Act of February 2, 1901. On March 22, 1901, while the
Taft Commission was going around the islands with their Federal party
folk, holding out the prospect of office to those who would quit
insurging and come in and be good, General MacArthur reported progress
to Secretary of War Root by cable as follows: &ldquo;Hope report
cessation of hostilities before June 30.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8046src" href="#xd27e8046" name="xd27e8046src">6</a> His idea was
to get a good military grip on the situation, if possible, by that
time, and, as a corollary, of course, that the grip thus obtained
should be diligently retained for a long time, not loosened, so that
the disturbed conditions incident to many years of war might have a few
years, at least, in which to settle. In his annual report dated July 4,
1901, the date of the inauguration of Judge Taft as &ldquo;Civil
Governor,&rdquo; he says, in regard to the imperative necessity for
continuing the military grip by keeping on hand sufficient forces:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name=
"pb355">355</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Anything in the immediate future calculated to impede
the activity or reduce the efficiency of these instruments will not
only be a menace to the present, but <i>put in jeopardy the entire
future of American possibilities</i> in the archipelago.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8058src" href="#xd27e8058" name=
"xd27e8058src">7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>General MacArthur believed in keeping the islands permanently. His
views were frankly imperialistic. He had no salve to offer to the
conscience of pious thrift at home anxious to believe that the
Filipinos were not bitterly opposed to our rule, and very much in favor
of what was supposed to be a glittering opening for Trade Expansion. He
was thoroughly imbued with the British colonial idea known as The White
Man&rsquo;s Burden. On the other hand, Governor Taft firmly believed
that kindness would cure the desire of the people for independence. The
difference between these two gentlemen was fully ventilated afterward
before the Senate Committee of 1902. A statement of General
MacArthur&rsquo;s embodying the crux of this difference was read to
Governor Taft by Senator Carmack, and the Governor&rsquo;s reply
was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We did not then agree with that statement, and we do
not now agree with it.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8068src" href=
"#xd27e8068" name="xd27e8068src">8</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A little later, in the same connection, he said to the same Senate
Committee, with the cheery tolerance of conflicting views which comes
only from entire confidence in the soundness of one&rsquo;s own:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I have been called the Mark Tapley of this Philippine
business.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt about the fact that President Taft is an optimist.
But while optimism is a very blessed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb356" href="#pb356" name="pb356">356</a>]</span>thing in a sick-room
or a financial panic, it is a very poor substitute for powder and lead
in putting down an insurrection, or in weaning people from a desire for
independence accentuated by a long war waged for that purpose,
especially when your kindness must be accompanied by assurances to the
objects of it that on account of a lack of sufficient intelligence they
are not fit for the thing they want. It was upon a programme of this
sort that Governor Taft entered upon the task of reconciling the
Filipinos to American rule more than ten years ago. The impossibility
of the task is of course obvious enough from the mere statement of it.
The subsequent bitterness between him and the military authorities was
quite carefully and very properly kept from the American public because
it might get back to the Filipino public. The military folk knew that
to go around the country setting up provincial and municipal
governments, carrying a liberal pay-roll, with diligent contemporaneous
circulation of the knowledge that anybody who would quit fighting would
stand a good chance to get an office, would seem to many of the
Filipinos a confession of weakness and fear, sure to cause trouble
later. Many of them&mdash;of course it would be inappropriate to
mention names&mdash;simply did not believe that Mr. Taft was honest in
his absurd notion. They simply damned &ldquo;politics&rdquo; for
meddling with war, and let it go at that. But the real epic pathos of
the whole thing was that Mr. Taft was actually sincere. He believed
that the majority of the Philippine people were for him and his
policies. As late as 1905, he seems to have clung to this idea,
according to various accounts by Senators Newlands, Dubois, and others,
in magazine articles written after their return from a trip to the
Philippines in that year in company with Mr. Taft, then Secretary of
War. In fact so impressed were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357"
href="#pb357" name="pb357">357</a>]</span>they with the general
discontent out there, and yet so considerate of their good friend Mr.
Taft&rsquo;s feelings in the matter and his confidence that the
Filipinos loved benevolent alien domination, that one of them simply
contented himself with the remark:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">When we left the islands I do not believe there was a
single member of our party who was not sorry we own them, except
Secretary Taft himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed it is not until 1907 that, we find Mr. Taft&rsquo;s paternal
solicitude for his step-daughter, Miss Filipina, finally reconciling
itself to the idea that while this generation seems to want Home Rule
as irreconcilably as Ireland herself and &ldquo;wont be happy
&rsquo;til it gets it,&rdquo; yet inasmuch as Home Rule is not, in his
judgment, good for every people, this generation is therefore a wicked
and perverse generation, and hence the Filipinos must simply resign
themselves to the idea of being happy in some other generation. This
attitude was freely stated before the Millers&rsquo; convention at St.
Louis, May 30, 1907, the speech being reported in the <i>St. Louis
Globe-Democrat</i> the next day. Said Mr. Taft on that occasion, after
admitting that the Islands had been a tremendous financial drain on
us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">If, then, we have not had material recompense, have we
had it in the continuing gratitude of the people whom we have
aided?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Answering this, in effect, though not in so many words, &ldquo;Alas,
no,&rdquo; he adds, with a sigh which is audible between the lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">He who would measure his altruism by the thankfulness
of those whom he aids, will not persist in good works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name=
"pb358">358</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus we see the Mark Tapley optimism of 1902 become in 1907 a
species of solicitude which Dickens describes in <i>Bleak House</i> as
&ldquo;Telescopic Philanthropy,&rdquo; in the chapter by that title in
which he introduces the famous Mrs. Jellyby, mother of a large and
interesting family, &ldquo;a lady of very remarkable strength of
character, who devotes herself entirely to the public,&rdquo; who
&ldquo;has devoted herself to an extensive variety of public subjects,
at various times, and is at present devoted to the subject of Africa,
with a general view to the cultivation of the coffee
berry&mdash;<i>and</i> the natives,&rdquo;&mdash;to the woeful neglect
of her own domestic concerns and her large and expensive family of
children. Since 1907, Mr. Taft has frankly abandoned his early delusion
about the consent-of-the-governed, and boldly takes the position, up to
that time more or less evaded, that the consent of the governed is not
at all essential to just government.</p>
<p>The apotheosis of Uncle Sam as Mrs. Jellyby is to be found in one of
Mr. Taft&rsquo;s speeches wherein he declared that the present
Philippine policy was &ldquo;a plan for the spread of Christian
civilization in the Orient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus has it been that, under the reactionary influence of a colonial
policy, this republic has followed its frank abandonment of the idea
that all just government must derive its origin in the consent of the
governed by a further abandonment of the idea that Church and State
should be kept separate. I do not wish to make President Taft
ridiculous, and could not if I would. Nor do I seek to belittle him in
the eyes of his people,&mdash;for we <i>are</i> &ldquo;his
people,&rdquo; for the time being. No one can belittle him. He is too
big a man to be belittled by anybody. Besides, he is, in many respects
beyond all question, a truly great man. But he is not the only great
man in history who has made egregious blunders. And there is no
question that we are running there on <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb359" href="#pb359" name="pb359">359</a>]</span>the confines of Asia,
in the Philippines, a superfluous governmental kindergarten whose
sessions should be concluded, not suddenly, but without unnecessary
delay. The two principal reasons for retaining the Filipinos as
subjects, or &ldquo;wards,&rdquo; or by whatever euphemism any one may
prefer to designate the relation, are, first, that a Filipino
government would not properly protect life and property, and second,
that although they complain much at taxation without representation
through tariff and other legislation placed or kept on the statute
books of Congress through the influence and for the benefit of special
interests in the United States, yet that such taxation without
representation is not so grievous as to justify them in feeling as we
did in 1776. Whether these reasons for retaining the Filipinos as
subjects indefinitely are justified by the facts, must depend upon the
facts. If they are not, the question will then arise, &ldquo;Would a
Filipino government be any worse for the Filipinos than the one we are
keeping saddled on them over their protest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his letter of instructions of April 7, 1900, to the Taft
Commission, Mr. McKinley first quoted the noble concluding language
with which the articles of capitulation of the city of Manila gave an
immediate and supremely comforting sense of security to a city of some
three hundred thousand people who had then been continuously in terror
of their lives for three and one half months, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">This city, its inhabitants, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and its
private property of all description *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* are placed under
the special safeguard of the faith and honor of the American army;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">As high and sacred an obligation rests upon the
Government of the United States to give protection for property
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=
"pb360">360</a>]</span>and life *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* to all the people of
the Philippine Islands. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I charge this commission to
labor for the full performance of this obligation, which concerns the
honor and conscience of their country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How the premature setting up of the civil government of the
Philippines in 1901 under pressure of political expediency, and the
consequent withdrawal of the police protection of the army, was
followed by a long series of disorders combated by prosecutions for
sedition and brigandage, toward the end of which the writer broke down
and left the Islands exclaiming inwardly, &ldquo;I do not know the
method of drawing an indictment against a whole people,&rdquo; will now
be traced, not so much to show that the Philippine insular government
has failed properly and competently to meet the most sacred obligations
that can rest upon any government, but to show the inherent unfitness
of a government based on the consent of the governed to run any other
kind of a government.</p>
<p>There were five officers of the Philippine volunteer army of
1899&ndash;1901 appointed to the bench by Governor Taft in 1901. Their
names and the method of their transition from the military to the civil
<i>r&eacute;gime</i> are indicated by the following communication, a
copy of which was furnished to each, as indicated in the endorsement
which follows the signature of Judge Taft:</p>

<p>General Smith had come out as colonel of the 1st Californias, and
had won his stars on the field of battle, as has already been described
in an earlier chapter. He went from the army to the Supreme
Bench&mdash;at Manila. The archipelago had been divided by the Taft
Commission into fifteen judicial districts, containing three or four
provinces each,&mdash;each district court to be a <i>nisi prius</i> or
trial court. Judge Carson (Va.) went to the Hemp Peninsula District in
the extreme south of Luzon, already described, and four years later to
the Supreme Bench, where he still is. Judge Ickis (Ia.) went to
Mindanao, and later died of the cholera down there. Judge Whitsett
(Mo.) went to Jolo (the little group of islets near British North
Borneo), but his wife died soon afterward, and he resigned and came
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name=
"pb362">362</a>]</span>home. The writer (Ga.) went to northern Luzon,
to the First District hereinafter noticed.</p>
<p>Just here it may be remarked that the reader will need no long
complicated description of the details of the organization of the new
government, interspersed with unpronounceable names, if he will simply
assume the view-point Governor Taft had in the beginning. Governor Taft
simply analogized his situation to that of a governor of a State or
Territory at home. His fifty provinces were to him fifty counties,
twenty-five of them in the main island of Luzon, which, as heretofore
stated, is about the size of Ohio or Cuba (forty odd thousand square
miles), and contains half the population and over one-third the total
land area of the archipelago. However, each of his provincial governors
was liberally paid, and the authority of a governor of a province was,
on a small scale, more like that of one of our own state chief
executives than like the authority and functions of the chairman of the
Board of County Commissioners of a county with us. For instance, the
governorship of Cebu, with its 2000 square miles of territory and
650,000 inhabitants, was quite as big a job as the governorship of New
Mexico, or some other one of our newer States.</p>
<p>So that the task on which Governor Taft entered July 4, 1901, was
the governing of a potential ultimate federal union in miniature,
containing nearly eight millions of people. One slight mistake I think
he made was in providing that the governors of the provinces should be
ex-officio sheriffs of the Courts of First Instance (of the fifteen
several judicial districts aforesaid). This was to enable the Judges of
First Instance to keep a weather eye on the provincial governors, the
judiciary at first being largely American, and it being the programme
to have native governors, some of them <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb363" href="#pb363" name="pb363">363</a>]</span>recently surrendered
insurgent generals, as rapidly as practicable and advisable. The scheme
was good business, but not tactful. It subtracted some wind from the
gubernatorial sails to be a sheriff, a provincial governor under the
Spanish <i>r&eacute;gime</i> having been quite a vice-regal potentate.
But the judges were as careful to treat their native governors with the
consideration the authority vested in them called for as Governor Taft
himself would have been. So no substantial harm was done, and the real
power in the provinces of questionable loyalty remained where it
belonged, in American hands.</p>
<p>Just after Governor Taft&rsquo;s inauguration, the four newly
appointed district judges just out of the army called on the governor.
Judge Carson was the spokesman, though without pre-arrangement. He
said: &ldquo;Governor, we have called to pay our respects and say
goodbye before going to the provinces. We have been acting under
military orders so long, that while we are not here to get orders, we
would like to have any parting suggestions that may occur to
you.&rdquo; Governor Taft said: &ldquo;Well, Gentlemen, all I can think
of is to remind you that if what we have all heard is true the Spanish
courts usually operated to the delay of justice, rather than to the
dispensing of it. So just go ahead to your respective districts, and
get to work, remembering that you are Americans.&rdquo; So we did. Of
course none of us loaned ourselves for a moment to the amiable Taft
fiction that &ldquo;the great majority of the people are entirely
willing to government under the supremacy of the United States.&rdquo;
We had all had a share in the subjugation of the Islands as far as it
had progressed at that time, and had seen the Filipinos
fight&mdash;unskilfully and ineffectively, it is true (because they
none of them understood the use of two sights on a rifle, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364" name=
"pb364">364</a>]</span>simply could not hit us much), but pluckily
enough. We knew the Filipinos well, and our attitude was simply that of
&ldquo;Pharaoh and the Sergeant,&rdquo; in Kipling&rsquo;s ballad of
the conquest of Egypt. However, we knew nothing of the Egyptians,
except what we had learned in the Bible, gave no thought to whether our
occupation was to be &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; like the British
occupation of Egypt since 1882, or temporary like the American
occupation of Cuba in 1898. That was a matter for the people of the
United States to determine later. But somebody had to govern the
Islands, and there we were, and there were the Islands. In the scheme
of things some one had to do that part of the world&rsquo;s work, and,
as the salaries were liberal, we went to the work, not concerning
ourselves with amiable fictions of any kind. I think our attitude was
really one of more intimately sympathetic understanding of the
Filipinos than that of Governor Taft himself, because we had all known
them longer, and all spoke their language, <i>i. e.</i>, the language
of the educated and representative men (Spanish), and knew their ways,
their foibles, and their many indisputably noble traits. But we did not
start out to play the part of political wet-nurses. Our attitude was,
if Mr. Filipino does not behave, we will make him.</p>
<p>Judge Carson and myself had one peculiar qualification for fidelity
to the Taft policies for which we were entitled to no credit. We
instinctively resented any suggestion comparing the Filipinos to
negroes. We had many warm friends among the Filipinos, had shared their
generous hospitality often, and in turn had extended them ours. Any
such suggestion as that indicated implied that we had been doing
something equivalent to eating, drinking, dancing, and chumming with
negroes. And we resented such suggestions with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name="pb365">365</a>]</span>an
anger quite as cordial and intense as the canons of good taste and
loyal friendship demanded. I really believe that the southern men in
the Philippines have always gotten along better with the Filipinos than
any other Americans out there, and for the reasons just suggested. Not
only is the universal American willingness to treat the educated
Asiatic as a human being endowed with certain unalienable rights going
to redeem him from the down-trodden condition into which British and
other European contempt for him has kept him, but the American from the
South out there is a guarantee that he shall never be treated as if he
were an African. The African is &aelig;ons of time behind the Asiatic
in development; the latter is &aelig;ons ahead of us in the mere
duration of his civilization. The Filipino has many of the virtues both
of the European and the Asiatic. Christianity has made him the superior
in many respects, of his neighbor and racial cousin, the Japanese. And
Spanish civilization has produced among them many educated gentlemen
whom it is an honor to call friend.</p>
<p>The five lawyers, who on ceasing to be volunteer officers became
judges, had other incentives also to make the Taft Government a
success. The possession of power is always pleasant. We knew the
military folk were going to stand by and watch the civil government,
and prophesy failure. This of course put us on our metal to impress
upon the dictatorial gentry of the military profession, with didactic
firmness, the fundamental importance to all American ideals that the
military should be subordinate to the civil authority.</p>
<p>The First Judicial District to which the writer was first assigned
comprised four provinces, Ilocos Norte, in the Ilocano country, the
province situated at the extreme northwestern corner of Luzon, in the
military <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span>district the conquest of which by General Young
has already been fully described; and the three provinces of the
Cagayan valley,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8238src" href="#xd27e8238"
name="xd27e8238src">9</a> overrun by Captain Batchelor on his
remarkable march from the mountains to the sea in November, 1899, also
already described. Here I remained for a year, and then came home on
leave, desperately ill; being given, on returning to the Islands after
my recovery, an assignment in one of the southern islands, hereinafter
dealt with.</p>
<p>We volunteers were all commissioned as judges as of the 15th of
June, though none of us I believe were mustered out until June 30th.
The day after I was notified of my appointment as judge, as above set
forth, desiring to enter upon my judicial emoluments, which were
several times those I was receiving as a soldier, I removed the
shoulder-straps and collar ornaments from my white duck suit, and went
over and took the oath of office before the Chief Justice of the
Islands. We had not yet been mustered out of the army, but as above
stated, Governor Taft had suggested to General MacArthur that we resign
without waiting for the day of muster out, so we could get to work that
much sooner, and General MacArthur had notified us that if we cared to
resign at once as suggested, he would cable our resignations to
Washington. Immediately after qualifying before the Chief Justice, I
left his office and on emerging from the court-house hailed a <i lang=
"es">carromata</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8247src" href=
"#xd27e8247" name="xd27e8247src">10</a> but the driver said No, he
would not carry me. I suggested in a very rudimental way, in rather
rudimental Spanish suited to him, that he was a common carrier, and as
such under a duty to transport me. He said his horse was tired. His
horse did not look tired. He would not have thus casually toyed with
veracity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=
"pb367">367</a>]</span>if I had had my shoulder-straps on. An <i lang=
"es">autoridad</i> (a representative of constituted authority) is to
the masses of the Filipino people something which instinctively
challenges their respect and obedience, more especially where the
&ldquo;authority&rdquo; is firm and just. Respect for authority is
their most conspicuous civic trait, and it is on this element in the
lower ninety, on the intelligence and capacity to guide them of the
upper ten, and on the ardent patriotism of both, that I predicate my
difference with President Taft as to the capacity of the Filipino
people for self-government. However, as I was to all appearances not an
&ldquo;authority,&rdquo; this ignorant man treated me as merely one of
the Americans who, having invaded his country, apparently were not sure
whether they were afraid of his people or not. Again I tried diplomacy,
offering him an exorbitant fare. &ldquo;Nothing doing.&rdquo; It was
about siesta time, and he would not budge. Here then was the civil
government proposition in a nutshell, to take the ignorant people and
teach them their rights under theoretically free institutions, instead
of letting their own people do it <i>in their own way</i>; to reason
directly with such people as this <i lang="es">cochero</i> (hackman),
to begin at the bottom of the social scale right on the jump, the idea
being to fit them, the sacred (?) majority, to know their rights and
&ldquo;knowing dare maintain&rdquo; them against the educated minority,
as if the latter did not have a greater natural interest in their
welfare than any stranger could possibly have. That I indulged all
these reflections at the time I of course do not mean to say. The
significance of the incident has of course deepened in the light of the
subsequent years. At any rate, I did not succeed in budging that
<i lang="es">cochero</i>. I walked home, forego the difference between
the military and the judicial salary for the two weeks remaining before
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name=
"pb368">368</a>]</span>muster-out day, put my shoulder-straps back on,
and kept them on until June 30, 1901.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8267src" href="#xd27e8267" name="xd27e8267src">11</a></p>
<p>When I first landed on the China seacoast of the district I was to
preside over, I was met by quite a reception committee of the leading
men, who conducted me with great courtesy to the provincial capital. A
little later the justices of the peace paid their respects. One of them
came thirty miles to do so. The court-room was very long, and when I
first spied this last man, he was at the other end of the room bowing
very low. He would bow, then advance a few steps, then bow again, then
resume the forward march toward me. I reminded myself of some ancient
king, so profound were his obeisances. At first I thought to myself,
&ldquo;He bows too low, he must have been up to some devilment
lately!&rdquo; Experience showed me later that it was simply one of the
ever-present manifestations of the respect of the Filipino for
constituted authority. They positively love to show their respect for
authority, just as a good soldier loves to show his respect for an
officer. Here some American remarks: &ldquo;Ah, but that is not good
proof of capacity for self-government. They would not &lsquo;cuss
out&rsquo; the party in power enough.&rdquo; I answer: Who made you the
judge to say that our particular form of government and our particular
way of doing things is better for each and every other people under the
sun than any they can devise for themselves? But there was of course
another possible reason for the profundity of the obeisances of my
judicial subordinate above mentioned. When I reached that province
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name=
"pb369">369</a>]</span>of Ilocos Norte in July, 1901, the people were
in a state of submission that was simply abject. They had at first
worked the <i lang="es">amigo</i> business on General Young, and
treachery of that kind had been so inexorably followed by dire
punishment, that every home in the country had its lesson. Yet that was
the only way. The poor devils did not seem to know when they were
licked. This is not maudlin sentiment. It is a protest against the
cotemporary libel on Filipino patriotism about &ldquo;the great
majority&rdquo; being &ldquo;entirely willing&rdquo; to accept our
rule, and the cotemporary belittling of the work the army had to do to
make them accept it.</p>
<p>I remained in charge of the First Judicial District for more than a
year, and during that period tried few or no crimes of a political
character, that is to say, indictments for sedition or the
like&mdash;attempts to subvert the government. The district comprised a
total population of about a half million people, more than one-eighth
of the population of Luzon, and a total area of over 13,000 square
miles, nearly one-third of all Luzon. But remember, this was in
northern Luzon, where the work of pacification was lucidly completed by
the army before the &ldquo;peace-at-any-price&rdquo; policy began. We
will see what happened in my friend Judge Carson&rsquo;s district, and
in the rest of southern Luzon later. The principal broad general fact I
now recall, in connection with the administration of justice in the
First Judicial District during the year or more I had it, is that the
main volume of business on the court calendars was crimes of violence
of a strictly non-political character due to lack of efficient police
protection in the several communities, consequent on withdrawal of
military garrisons. The country was in an unsettled state. The
aftermath of war, lawless violence, was virulently <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370" name=
"pb370">370</a>]</span>present, and the presence of troops scattered
through a province, under such circumstances, is a wonderful moral
force to restrain lawlessness. However high the purpose, however kindly
the motive, the setting up of a civil government in the Philippines at
the time it was set up, when the country was far from ready for it, was
a terrible mistake. Of course no one man in a given province or
judicial district had a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the whole situation
and the whole panorama at the time, such as we can get at this
distance, in retrospect. Of course it did not lie in human nature for
the men responsible for the mistake to see it at first, and, the die
once cast, they had to keep on, with intermittent resort to military
help, the extent of which help was always minimized thereafter. To show
how little the general state of the archipelago was understood by
American provincial officials busy in a given part of it, and getting
little or no news of the outside world, I remained in the First
Judicial District from July, 1901, to August, 1902, and heard nothing
of the great insurrection in southern Luzon, in Batangas, and the
adjacent provinces, which raged during the winter of 1901&ndash;02,
except a vague rumor that there was trouble down there. The Filipinos
did, however. Of course for Mr. Root to be able to furnish in December,
1901, a report, as Secretary of War, to the President, for consumption
by Congress and the people of this country, to the effect that his
volunteer army had been mustered out on schedule time, June 30, 1901,
and a &ldquo;civil&rdquo; government set up and in due operation, was a
nice showing, calculated to sooth latent public discontent with wading
through slaughter to over-seas dominion. Reports thereafter of
disturbances could always be waived aside as merely local in character,
and not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href="#pb371" name=
"pb371">371</a>]</span>serious. If it were stoutly asserted that
everything was quiet all over the archipelago except in certain parts
of certain localities, naming them, that sounded well, and as the
public at home simply skipped the unpronounceable names, not caring
much whether they represented molecules or hemispheres, all went well.
For instance, most of the provinces of the archipelago were organized
under &ldquo;civil&rdquo; government prior to the inauguration of
Governor Taft, which occurred, July 4, 1901, and on July 17th,
thereafter, Batangas, Cebu, and Bohol were restored to military
control.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8283src" href="#xd27e8283" name=
"xd27e8283src">12</a> I suppose the fact that Batangas, Cebu, and Bohol
had been so restored was duly announced at the time in the Associated
Press despatches from Manila. But what light did it throw on the
situation? Who knew whether any one of these names represented a
mountain lair, a country village, a remote islet, or a large and
populous province? As a matter of fact, each was a province, and the
total population of the three provinces was 1,180,655,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8286src" href="#xd27e8286" name=
"xd27e8286src">13</a> and their total area 4651 square miles.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8292src" href="#xd27e8292" name=
"xd27e8292src">14</a> The eminent gentlemen charged with the government
of the Islands, once they committed themselves to their
&ldquo;civil&rdquo; government, persisted always in treating the
insurrection, as General Hancock&rsquo;s campaign speeches used to
treat the tariff&mdash;as &ldquo;a local issue.&rdquo; The true
analogy, that of a house on fire, with the fire partly but not wholly
under control, and momentarily subject to gusts of wind, never seems to
have occurred to them. Here were provinces aggregating nearly twelve
hundred <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name=
"pb372">372</a>]</span>thousand people, officially admitted to be still
in insurrection within less than two weeks after the announcement of
the inauguration of a civil government, which included them, with its
implied assertion of a state of peace as to them.</p>
<p>If to the three provinces above named you add the province of Samar,
later of dark and bloody fame, you have a fourth province as to which
not only had there been no &ldquo;civil&rdquo; government organized on
paper, but no claim yet made by any one that we had ever conquered it.
We had been so busy in Luzon and elsewhere that we had not yet had time
to bother very much with Samar. The area of Samar is 5276 square miles,
and its population 266,237. (See the census tables already cited.) In
their report dated October 15, 1901,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8302src" href="#xd27e8302" name="xd27e8302src">15</a> you find
the Commission admitting that &ldquo;the insurrection still continues
in Batangas, Samar, Cebu&rdquo; and &ldquo;parts of&rdquo; Laguna and
Tayabas provinces. Now the euphemistic limitation implied in the words
&ldquo;parts of&rdquo; is quite negligible, for any serious purpose,
since our troops kept the insurgents rather constantly on the move, and
the population in all the &ldquo;parts of&rdquo; any province that was
still holding out backed up the combatants morally and materially, with
information as to our movements, supplies, etc., whenever the insurgent
detachments, in the course of their peregrinations, happened to pass
through those &ldquo;parts.&rdquo; So, to make a recapitulation
presenting the political situation admitted by the Commission to exist
a little over three months after the inauguration of civil government,
we have the insurrection still in progress as follows: <span class=

<p>According to his own official statements, it thus appears that on
October 15th, after Governor Taft set up his &ldquo;civil&rdquo;
government on the Fourth of July, throughout one-fifth of the territory
and among one-fourth of the population insurrection was rampant. The
total area of the archipelago, if Mohammedan Mindanao be excepted (for
the reason that the Moros never had anything to do with the Filipinos
and their insurrection against us), is about 80,000 square miles,
having a total population of 7,000,000. So that, to restate the case,
one-fifth of the house was still on fire, and one-fourth of the inmates
were trying their best to keep the fire from being put out.</p>
<p>Just here I owe it to President Taft, under whose administration as
governor I served as a judge, as well as to myself, to explain why I
have so frequently put the word &ldquo;civil&rdquo; in quotations in
referring to the civil government of the Philippines. Broadly speaking,
if &ldquo;civil&rdquo; does not imply consent of the governed, it at
least distinctly negatives the idea of a bleeding, prostrate, and
deeply hostile people. And, in that the civil government of the
Philippines founded in 1901 did so negative the actual conditions it
was a kindly humbug. When you go around the country sending people to
the penitentiary by scores for political crimes, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name="pb374">374</a>]</span>and
then get criticised afterwards for &ldquo;subserviency&rdquo; to the
government you are thus serving, you get a trifle sensitive about such
criticism. Now the core of the charges made in this country against the
Philippine judiciary in the early days was that they were parties to a
humbug, pliable servants of a government which was trying to produce at
home an incorrect impression of substantial <i>absence of
unwillingness</i> on the part of the governed. I am very sure that the
five ex-officers of the volunteer army above named, who went from the
army to the bench, never did, by act or word, lend themselves to the
idea that there was any &ldquo;consent&rdquo; on the part of the
governed. Those of us who had been in Cuba with General Wood had but a
little while previously observed there a <i>civil r&eacute;gime</i>
under a <i>military</i> name. We were now, in the Philippines, serving
a <i>military r&eacute;gime</i> under a <i>civil</i> name. We had all
of us doubtless&mdash;if there was an exception it is
immaterial&mdash;served on military commissions. We therefore felt,
without immodesty, that we could deal out to insurrectos and their
political cousins, the brigands, more even-handed justice, as a
<i>military commission of one</i>, than a board of several officers,
booted, spurred, and travel-stained from some recent man-hunt. Turning,
however, from the more inconspicuous objects of Professor
Willis&rsquo;s attacks,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8401src" href=
"#xd27e8401" name="xd27e8401src">16</a> the American trial judges in
the Philippines in the pioneer days, to the now wide-looming historic
personage who was his real objective, I was asked at a public meeting
in Boston, rather significantly, by one of the most eminent lawyers in
this country, Mr. Moorfield Storey, formerly president of the American
Bar Association, whether or not there had <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb375" href="#pb375" name="pb375">375</a>]</span>been attempts in the
Philippines, while I was there, to make the judiciary subservient to
the executive. My answer was, &ldquo;No, the lawyers who have been in
charge of the Philippine Government have never been guilty of any
unprofessional conduct.&rdquo; But the distinguished Boston barrister
above referred to has a nephew who is now and has been since 1909,
Governor of the Philippines&mdash;and who, before he went out there was
a representative of Big Business in Boston&mdash;Governor Forbes, and I
have no idea that any judge who during that time has rendered any
decision of importance he did not like has been promoted to the Supreme
Bench of the Islands, though I know that under Governor Taft, Judge
Carson unhesitatingly declared a certain act of the Commission null and
void as being in conflict with an Act of Congress, and before the
time-servers had gotten through wondering at his rashness, Mr. Taft had
him put on the Supreme Bench of the Philippines<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8412src" href="#xd27e8412" name="xd27e8412src">17</a> because he
liked that kind of a judge.</p>
<p>Having sown the wind by setting up his civil government too soon,
let us now observe the whirlwind Governor Taft reaped within six months
thereafter. Of course the civil and military folk were at
daggers&rsquo; points. That goes without saying. But their differences
were decorously suppressed so that the Filipinos did not get hold of
them. To that end, the situation was also diligently concealed in the
United States. In his proclamation of July 4, 1902, you find President
Roosevelt publicly smoothing the ruffled feathers of that rugged hero
of many battles in two hemispheres, General Chaffee, and also
commending Governor Taft, and telling them how harmoniously they had
gotten along together to the credit of their common country. But in
1901, shortly after General Chaffee <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb376" href="#pb376" name="pb376">376</a>]</span>had relieved General
MacArthur, you find the following cablegram:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first dateline"><span class="sc">Executive Mansion,
Washington</span>,<br>
October 8, 1901.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Chaffee, Manila</span>: I am deeply chagrined, to
use the mildest possible term, over the trouble between yourself and
Taft. I wish you to see him personally, and spare no effort to secure
prompt and friendly agreement in regard to the differences between you.
Have cabled him also. It is most unfortunate to have any action which
produces friction and which may have a serious effect both in the
Philippines <i>and here at home</i>. I trust implicitly that you and
Taft will come to agreement.</p>
<p class="signed"><span class="sc">Theodore Roosevelt</span>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e8437src" href="#xd27e8437" name=
"xd27e8437src">18</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most important words of the above telegram are &ldquo;and here
at home.&rdquo; The &ldquo;serious effect here at home&rdquo; so
earnestly deprecated was that the real issue between General Chaffee
and Governor Taft might be ventilated by some Congressional Committee,
and thus bring out the prematurity with which, to meet political
exigencies, the civil government had been set up. The issue was that
General Chaffee was recognizing the hostility of the people, and
deprecating the withdrawal of the police protection of the army from
districts in which there were many people who, though tired of keeping
up the struggle, and willing to quit, were being harried by the
die-in-the-last-ditch contingent. This would mean, ultimately, an
examination, such as has already been made in this volume, of the
evidence on which Governor Taft based his half-baked opinion of 1900
that &ldquo;the great majority&rdquo; were &ldquo;entirely
willing&rdquo; to American sovereignty. It would also show up Mr.
Root&rsquo;s nonsense about &ldquo;the patient and unconsenting
millions,&rdquo; so shamelessly flouted in the presidential
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377" name=
"pb377">377</a>]</span>campaign of 1900, and his pious Philippics
against delivering said millions &ldquo;into the hands of the assassin,
Aguinaldo,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8446src" href="#xd27e8446"
name="xd27e8446src">19</a> and would reveal the truth confessed by
Secretary Root in a speech made to the cadets at West Point in July,
1902, after the trouble had blown over, in which, apropos of the valor
and services of the army, he referred proudly to its having then just
completed the suppression of &ldquo;an insurrection of 7,000,000
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On September 28, 1901, just prior to President Roosevelt&rsquo;s
above cablegram pouring oil on the troubled politico-military insular
waters, a company of General Chaffee&rsquo;s command, Company C, of the
9th Infantry, had been taken off their guard and massacred at a place
called Balangiga, in the island of Samar.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8451src" href="#xd27e8451" name="xd27e8451src">20</a> This had
made General Chaffee somewhat angry, and explains the subsequent dark
and bloody drama of which General &ldquo;Jake&rdquo; Smith was the
central figure, whereby Samar was made &ldquo;a howling
wilderness.&rdquo; But Governor Taft was filled with much more
solicitude about the success of his civil government than he was about
the obscure lives lost at Balangiga. Apropos of the Balangiga affair he
was wearing the patience of the doughty Chaffee with remarks like this:
&ldquo;The people are friendly to the civil government,&rdquo; and
suavely speaking of &ldquo;the evidence which accumulates on every hand
of the desire of the people at large for peace and protection by the
civil government.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8460src" href=
"#xd27e8460" name="xd27e8460src">21</a> The same Taft <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name=
"pb378">378</a>]</span>report goes on to deprecate &ldquo;rigor in the
treatment&rdquo; of the situation and the &ldquo;consequent revulsion
in those feelings of friendship toward the Americans which have been
growing stronger each day with the spread and development of the civil
government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General &ldquo;Jake&rdquo; Smith was sent to Samar shortly after the
Balangiga massacre, and did indeed make the place a howling wilderness,
with his famous &ldquo;kill-and-burn&rdquo; orders, instructions to
&ldquo;kill everything over ten years old&rdquo; and so forth, and the
army was in sympathy generally with most of what he did,&mdash;except,
of course, the unspeakable &ldquo;10 year old&rdquo; part&mdash;piously
exclaiming, as fallible human nature often will in such circumstances,
&ldquo;Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord.&rdquo; Now the civil
government could have put a stop to all this if it had wanted to. It
had the backing of President Roosevelt. But it quietly accepted the
benefit of such &ldquo;fear of God&rdquo;&mdash;to use the army&rsquo;s
rather sacrilegious expression about that Samar campaign&mdash;as the
military arm put into the heart of the Filipino, and went on the even
tenor of its way, still maintaining that the Filipinos must like us
because the civil government was so benevolent,&mdash;as if the
Filipinos drew any nice distinctions between Governor Taft and General
Chaffee, or supposed the two did not represent one and the same
government, the government of the United States. There was much
investigation about that awful Samar campaign afterward. General Smith
was court-martialed and partly whitewashed, at least not dismissed. At
General Smith&rsquo;s court-martial, there was some dispute about the
alleged orders to &ldquo;kill and burn,&rdquo; to &ldquo;kill
everything over ten years old,&rdquo; etc. But the nature of the
campaign may be inferred from General Smith&rsquo;s famous circular No.
6, which, issued on Christmas eve, 1901, advised his command, in
effect, that he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379"
name="pb379">379</a>]</span>did not take much stock in the civil
commission&rsquo;s confidence that the people really wanted peace; that
he was &ldquo;thoroughly convinced&rdquo; that the wealthy people in
the towns of his district were aiding the insurgents while pretending
to be friendly and that he proposed to</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">adopt a policy that will create <i>in all the minds of
all the people a burning desire for the war to cease</i>; a desire or
longing <i>so intense, so personal, and so real</i> that it will
<i>impel</i> them to devote themselves in real earnest to bringing
about a <i>real state</i> of peace.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8487src"
href="#xd27e8487" name="xd27e8487src">22</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>During all his trial troubles, General Smith &ldquo;took what was
coming to him&rdquo; without a murmur, and General Chaffee stuck to him
as far as he could without assuming the primary responsibility for the
fearful orders above alluded to. If, when General Smith went to Samar,
his superior officer, General Chaffee, was in just the direly vengeful
frame of mind he, General Smith, afterwards displayed, and prompted him
to do, substantially, what he afterward did, which is by no means
unlikely, General Smith never whimpered or put the blame on his chief.
But a fearful lesson was given the Filipinos, and the civil government
profited by it. General Chaffee was never really pressed on whether he
did or did not prompt General Smith to do what he did; Governor Taft
was never even criticised for not protesting; but with a flourish of
presidential trumpets, General Smith was finally made &ldquo;the
goat,&rdquo; by being summarily placed on the retired list, and that
closed the bloody Samar episode of 1901&ndash;02. I wonder General
Smith has not gone and wept on General Miles&rsquo;s shoulder and like
him become a member of the Anti-Imperialist League of Boston. Some of
the best fighting men in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href=
"#pb380" name="pb380">380</a>]</span>the army say that as a soldier in
battle General Smith is superb. At any rate he may find spiritual
consolation in the following passage of the Scriptures which fits and
describes his case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the
scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the Lord, to make an
atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the
wilderness.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8499src" href="#xd27e8499" name=
"xd27e8499src">23</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his Report for 1901 Governor Taft says that the four principal
provinces, including Batangas, which gave trouble shortly after the
civil government was set up in that year, and had to be returned to
military control, were organized under civil rule &ldquo;on the
recommendation&rdquo; of the then commanding general
(MacArthur)<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8507src" href="#xd27e8507" name=
"xd27e8507src">24</a>: It certainly seems unlikely that the haste to
change from military rule to civil rule came on the motion of the
military. If the Commission ever got, <i>in writing</i>, from General
MacArthur, a &ldquo;recommendation&rdquo; that any provinces be placed
under civil rule while still in insurrection, the text of the writing
will show a mere soldiery acquiescence in the will of Mr. McKinley, the
commander-in-chief. Parol contemporaneous evidence will show that
General MacArthur told them, substantially, that they were
&ldquo;riding for a fall.&rdquo; In fact, whenever an insurrection
would break out in a province after Governor Taft&rsquo;s inauguration
as governor, the whole attitude of the army in the Philippines, from
the commanding general down, was &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo; They did
not say this where Governor Taft could hear it, but it was common
knowledge that they were much addicted to damning
&ldquo;politics&rdquo; as the cause of all the trouble. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href="#pb381" name="pb381">381</a>]</span></p>
<p>Governor Taft&rsquo;s statement in his report for 1901, that the
four principal provinces, above named, Batangas and the rest, were
organized under civil rule &ldquo;on the recommendation of General
MacArthur,&rdquo; is fully explained in his testimony before the Senate
Committee of 1902. From the various passages hereinbefore quoted from
President McKinley&rsquo;s state papers concerning the Philippines,
especially his messages to Congress, the political pressure Mr.
McKinley was under from the beginning to make a show of
&ldquo;civil&rdquo; government, thus emphasizing the alleged absence of
any real substantial opposition to our rule by a seeming absence of
necessity for the use of force, so as to palliate American repugnance
to forcing a government upon an unwilling people, has been made clear.
There were to be no &ldquo;dark days of reconstruction.&rdquo; The
Civil War in the United States from 1861 to 1865 was a love feast
compared with our war in the Philippines. Yet the work of
reconstruction in the Philippines was to be predicated on the theory of
consent, so persistently urged by President McKinley before the
American people from the beginning, viz., that the insurrection
represented only a small faction of the people. We have seen how
General MacArthur also had originally, in 1898, entertained this
notion, and how by the time he took Malolos in March, 1899, he had
gotten over this notion, and had&mdash;regretfully&mdash;recognized
that &ldquo;the whole people are loyal to Aguinaldo and the cause he
represents.&rdquo; And now came Governor Taft, after fifteen months
more of continuous fighting, to tell General MacArthur, on behalf of
Mr. McKinley, that he, MacArthur, did not know what he was talking
about, and that &ldquo;the great majority&rdquo; were for American
rule. The representative men of my own State of Georgia welcomed the
return of the State to military control in 1870. Most of them
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382" name=
"pb382">382</a>]</span>had been officers of the Confederate army. The
Federal commander simply told them that if <i>they</i> could not
restrain the lawless element of their own people, <i>he would</i>. By
premature setting up of the Philippine civil government, the lawless
element was allowed full swing. General MacArthur had been in the Civil
War. He knew something about reconstruction. But here were the Taft
Commission, with instructions from Mr. McKinley to the effect that
civil government, government &ldquo;essentially <i>popular</i> in
form,&rdquo; was to be set up as fast as territory was conquered. It
didn&rsquo;t make any difference about the government being
&ldquo;essentially popular&rdquo; just so it was &ldquo;essentially
popular <i>in form</i>.&rdquo; To the Senate Committee of 1902,
Governor Taft said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">General MacArthur and the Commission did differ as to
where the power lay with respect to the organization of civil
governments, as to <i>who should say what civil governments should be
organized</i>, the Commission contending that, under the instructions,
it was left to them, and General MacArthur thinking that everything was
subject to military control ultimately, in view of the fact that the
islands were <i>in a state of war</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8542src" href="#xd27e8542" name="xd27e8542src">25</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Governor Taft then added that he and General MacArthur reached a
<i>modus vivendi</i>. When a good soldier once finds out just what his
commander-in-chief wants done, he will endeavor, in loyal good faith,
to carry out the spirit of instructions, no matter how unwise they may
seem to him. As soon as General MacArthur saw what President McKinley
wanted done, he proceeded to co-operate loyally with Governor Taft to
carry out the plan. He well knew the country was not ready for civil
government, but if Mr. McKinley was bent on crowding civil government
forward as fast <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383"
name="pb383">383</a>]</span>as territory was conquered, he would make
his recommendations on that basis. In the matter of the utter folly of
the prematurity with which the civil government was set up in the
Philippines in 1901, and the terrible consequences to the hapless
Filipinos, hereinafter described, which followed, by reason of the
premature withdrawal of the police protection of the army and the sense
of security its several garrisons radiated, from a country just
recovering from some six years of war, General MacArthur&rsquo;s
exemption from responsibility is shown by his reports for 1900 and
1901.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8554src" href="#xd27e8554" name=
"xd27e8554src">26</a> The former has already been fully examined, and
the original sharp differences between him and Governor Taft made
clear. In the latter report dated July 4, 1901, the date of the Taft
inauguration as Governor, and also, if I mistake not, the day of
General MacArthur&rsquo;s final departure for the United States, the
latter washes his hands of the kindly McKinley-Taft nonsense, born of
political expediency, about there having never been any real
fundamental or unanimous resistance, in no uncertain terms thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Anything in the immediate future calculated to impede
the activity or reduce the efficiency of these instruments [our
military forces,] will not only be a menace to the present, but <i>put
in jeopardy the entire future of American possibilities in the
archipelago</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8573src" href="#xd27e8573"
name="xd27e8573src">27</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, President Taft can never make General MacArthur &ldquo;the
goat&rdquo; for what General Bell had to do in Batangas Province in
1901&ndash;02 to make our &ldquo;willing&rdquo; subjects behave. Nor
can the ultimate responsibility before the bar of history for the awful
fact that, according <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384"
name="pb384">384</a>]</span>to the United States Coast and Geodetic
Survey Atlas of the Philippines of 1899, the population of Batangas
Province was 312,192, and according to the American Census of the
Philippines of 1903 it was 257,715,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8582src"
href="#xd27e8582" name="xd27e8582src">28</a> rest entirely on military
shoulders. An attempt to place the responsibility for the prematurity
of the civil government on General MacArthur was made by Honorable
Henry C. Ide, who was of the Taft Commission of 1900, and later
Governor General of the Islands, and is now Minister to Spain, in the
<i>North American Review</i> for December, 1907. But Mr. Taft, a man of
nobler mould, has at least maintained a decorous silence on the subject
except when interrogated by Congress, and when so interrogated, his
testimony, above quoted, if analyzed, places the responsibility where
it honestly belongs. In 1900 the Taft Commission were not taking much
military advice.</p>
<p>Batangas province was first taken under the wing of the
peace-at-any-price policy by the Act of the Taft Commission of May 2,
1901, entitled &ldquo;An Act Extending the Provisions of &lsquo;the
Provincial Government Act&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8593src"
href="#xd27e8593" name="xd27e8593src">29</a> to the Province of
Batangas.&rdquo; By the Act of the Commission of July 17, 1901, the
provinces of Batangas, Cebu, and Bohol, were restored to military
control. When the civil authorities turned those provinces back to
military control, they well knew the frame of mind the military were
in, and there is no escape from the proposition that they, in effect,
said to the military: &ldquo;Take them and chasten them; go as far as
you like. After you are done with them, it will be time enough to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385" name=
"pb385">385</a>]</span>pet them again. But for the present we mean
business.&rdquo; General Bell was scathingly criticised on the floor of
the United States Senate for what he did in Batangas in 1901&ndash;02,
but by the time he took hold there it had become a case of &ldquo;spare
the rod and spoil the child.&rdquo; The substitution by the Commission
of kindness, and a disposition to forget what the Filipinos could not
forget, for firmness and the policy of making them submit unreservedly
to the inevitable,&mdash;viz., abandonment of their dream of
independence&mdash;had created among them a well-nigh ineradicable
impression that, for some reason or other, whether due to disapproval
in the United States of the so-called &ldquo;imperial&rdquo; policy or
what not, we were afraid of them. General Bell&rsquo;s task in
Batangas, therefore, was to eradicate this impression all over the
archipelago by making an example of the Batangas people.</p>
<p>In General Chaffee&rsquo;s report for 1902,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8600src" href="#xd27e8600" name="xd27e8600src">30</a> he prefaces
his account of General Bell&rsquo;s operations in Batangas as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The long-continued resistance in the province of
Batangas and in certain parts of the bordering provinces of Tayabas,
Laguna, and Cavite, had made it apparent to me and to others that the
insurrectionary force keeping up the struggle there could exist and
maintain itself only through the connivance and knowledge of
practically all the inhabitants; that it received the active support of
many who professed friendship for United States authority, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This last was a thrust at Governor Taft&rsquo;s new-found Filipino
friends and advisers, in whose lack of sympathy with the cause of their
country the Governor so profoundly believed, but in whose continuing
co-operation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href="#pb386" name=
"pb386">386</a>]</span>in the killing of his soldiers General Chaffee
believed still more profoundly.</p>
<p>General Bell&rsquo;s famous operations on a large scale in Batangas
began January 1, 1902. The great mistake of the Civil Commission, to
which they adhered so long, was in supposing that when the respectable
military element of the insurgents was pursued to capture or surrender,
these last <i>could</i> and <i>would</i> thereafter control the
situation. As a matter of fact, whether they could or not, they did
not.</p>
<p>In his celebrated circular order dated Batangas, December 9, 1901,
General Bell announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first salute">To all Station Commanders:</p>
<p>A general conviction, which the brigade commander shares, appears to
exist, that the insurrection in this brigade continues because the
greater part of the people, especially the wealthy ones, <i>pretend</i>
to desire, but do not in reality <i>want</i> peace; that when all
<i>really want</i> peace, we can have it promptly. Under such
circumstances, it is clearly indicated that a policy should be adopted
that will, as soon as possible, make the people <i>want peace</i> and
<i>want it badly</i>.</p>
<p>The only acceptable and convincing evidence of the real sentiments
of either individuals or town councils should be such acts publicly
performed as must <i>inevitably commit them irrevocably</i> to the side
of Americans by arousing the animosity of the insurgent element.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* No person should be given credit for loyalty simply
because he takes the oath of allegiance, or secretly conveys to
Americans worthless information and idle rumors which result in
nothing. Those who <i>publicly</i> guide our troops to the camps of the
enemy, who <i>publicly</i> identify insurgents, who <i>accompany troops
in operations</i> against the enemy, who denounce and assist in
arresting the secret enemies of the Government, who <i>publicly</i>
obtain and bring <i>reliable</i> and <i>valuable</i> information to
commanding officers, those in fact who <i>publicly</i> array themselves
against the insurgents, and for Americans, should be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name=
"pb387">387</a>]</span>trusted and given credit for loyalty, <i>but no
others</i>. No person should be given credit for loyalty solely on
account of having done nothing for or against us so far as known.
Neutrality should not be tolerated. Every inhabitant of this brigade
should be either active friend or be classed as enemy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his Circular Order No. 5, dated Batangas, December 13,
1901,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8678src" href="#xd27e8678" name=
"xd27e8678src">31</a> General Bell announced that General Orders No.
100, Adjutant General&rsquo;s Office, 1863, approved and published by
order of President Lincoln, for the government of the armies of the
United States in the field, would thereafter be regarded as the guide
of his subordinates in the conduct of the war. This order is familiar
to all who have ever made any study of military law. Ordinarily, of
course, a captured enemy is entitled to &ldquo;the honors of
war,&rdquo; <i>i. e.</i>, he must be held, housed, and fed, unless
exchanged, until the close of the war. But where an enemy places
himself by his conduct without the pale of the laws of war, <i>i.
e.</i>, where he does not &ldquo;play the game according to the
rules,&rdquo; he may be killed on sight, like other outlaws.</p>
<p>Under General Orders No. 100, 1863, men and squads of men who,
without commission, without being part or portion of the regularly
organized hostile army, fight occasionally only, and with intermittent
returns to their homes and avocations, and frequent assumption of the
semblance of peaceful pursuits, divesting themselves of the character
and appearance of soldiers; armed prowlers seeking to cut telegraph
wires, destroy bridges and the like, etc., are not entitled to the
protection of the laws of war and may be shot on sight. In other words,
the game being one of life and death, you must take even chances with
your opponent. General Bell&rsquo;s defenders on the floor of the
Senate simply relied <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388"
name="pb388">388</a>]</span>on General Orders No. 100. However, there
is nothing about reconcentration in that order. We learned that from
the Spaniards. In fact we never did succeed in bringing to terms the
far Eastern colonies we bought from Spain, until we adopted her methods
with regard to them. Another of the expedients adopted by General Bell
in Batangas seems harsh, but it was used by Wellington in the latter
end of the Napoleonic wars, and by the Germans in the latter end of the
Franco-Prussian War. It was to promise the inhabitants of a given
territory that whenever a telegraph wire or pole was cut the country
within a stated radius thereof, including all human habitations, would
be devastated. It is in General Bell&rsquo;s Circular Order No. 7 of
December 15, 1901,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8695src" href=
"#xd27e8695" name="xd27e8695src">32</a> that we find the genesis of the
idea of basing tactics used by Weyler in Cuba on Mr. Lincoln&rsquo;s
General Order 100. He there says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Though Section 17, General Orders 100, authorizes the
starving of unarmed hostile belligerents as well as armed ones,
provided it leads to a speedier subjection of the enemy, it is
considered neither justifiable nor desirable to permit any person to
starve <i>who has come into towns under our control seeking
protection</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This order goes on to direct that all food supplies encountered be
brought to the towns. Of course this does not mean supplies captured
from the enemy&rsquo;s forces, which may lawfully be destroyed at once.
To those not familiar with reconcentration tactics it should be
explained that reconcentration means this: You notify, by proclamation
and otherwise, all persons within a given area, that on and after a
certain day they must all leave their homes and come within a certain
prescribed zone or radius of which a named <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href="#pb389" name="pb389">389</a>]</span>town
is usually the centre, there to remain until further orders, and that
all persons found outside that zone after the date named will be
treated as public enemies. General Bell&rsquo;s order of December 20th,
provided that rice found in the possession of families outside the
protected zone should, if practicable, be moved with them to the town
which was the centre of the zone, that that found apparently
<i>cached</i> for enemy&rsquo;s use should be confiscated, and also
destroyed if necessary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Whenever it is found absolutely impossible to
transport it [any food supply] to a point within the protected zone, it
will be burned or otherwise destroyed. <i>These rules will apply to all
food products</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No person within the reconcentration zones was permitted to go
outside thereof&mdash;cross the dead line&mdash;without a written pass.
The Circular Order of December 23d, apparently solicitous lest
subordinate commanders might become infected with the Taft belief in
Filipino affection, directs that after January 1, 1902, all the
municipal officials, members of the police force, etc., &ldquo;who have
not <i>fully complied</i> with their duty by <i>actively</i> aiding the
Americans and rendering them <i>valuable</i> service,&rdquo; shall be
<i>summarily thrown into prison</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8736src" href="#xd27e8736" name="xd27e8736src">33</a> Circular
Order No. 19, issued on Christmas Eve, 1901, provided that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">in order to make the existing state o&pound; war and
martial law <i>so inconvenient and unprofitable to the people that they
will earnestly desire and work for</i> the re-establishment of peace
and <i>civil government</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>subordinate commanders might, under certain prescribed restrictions,
put everybody they chose to work on the roads.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8754src" href="#xd27e8754" name="xd27e8754src">34</a> This was an
ingenious blow at the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href=
"#pb390" name="pb390">390</a>]</span>wealthy and soft-handed, intended
to superinduce submission by humbling their pride. Note also the seeds
of affection thus sown for the civil government under the
reconstruction period which was to follow. In one of Dickens novels
there occurs a law firm by the name of Spenlow and Jorkins. Mr. Spenlow
was quite fond of considering himself, and of being considered by
others, as tender-hearted. Mr. Jorkins did not mind. When the widow and
the orphan would plead with Mr. Spenlow to stay the foreclosure of a
mortgage, that benevolent soul would tell them, with a pained
expression of infinite sympathy, that he would do all he could for
them, but that they would have to see Mr. Jorkins, &ldquo;who is a very
exacting man,&rdquo; he would say. In the dual American
politico-military r&eacute;gime in the Philippines of 1901&ndash;02,
Governor Taft was the Mr. Spenlow, General Chaffee the Mr. Jorkins. But
the former always seemed to harbor the amiable delusion that the
Filipinos did not at all consider <i>the firm</i> as the movants in
each proceeding against them, and that on the contrary they were sure
to make a favorable contrast in their hearts between the kindness of
Mr. Spenlow and the harshness of Mr. Jorkins. He seemed blind to the
fact that the Filipinos, in considering what was done by <i>any</i> of
us, spelled <i>us</i>&mdash;U. S.</p>
<p>General Bell&rsquo;s Circular Order No. 22, also a Christmas Eve
product, re-iterates the usual purpose to make the people yearn for
civil government, and the usual warning that none of them really and
truly want the blessings of American domination and Benevolent
Assimilation as they truly should, and adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">To combat such a population, it is necessary to make
the state of war as insupportable as possible; and there is no more
efficacious way of accomplishing this than by <i>keeping <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name="pb391">391</a>]</span>the
minds of the people in such a state of anxiety and apprehension that
living under such conditions will soon become unbearable</i>. Little
should be said. The less said the better. Let acts, not words, convey
intentions.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8780src" href="#xd27e8780" name=
"xd27e8780src">35</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under date of December 26, 1901, General Bell reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I am now assembling in the neighborhood of 2500 men,
who will be used in columns of fifty each. I expect to accompany the
command. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I take so large a command for the purpose of
thoroughly searching <i>each ravine, valley, and mountain peak</i> for
insurgents and for food, expecting to <i>destroy everything I find
outside of town</i>. <i>All able-bodied men will be killed or
captured.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was the central idea animating the Bell Brigade that overran
Batangas in 1902. The American soldier in officially sanctioned wrath
is a thing so ugly and dangerous that it would take a Kipling to
describe him. I have seen him in that mood, but to describe it is
beyond me. Side by side with innumerable ambuscades incident to the
nature of the field service as it then was, in which little affairs the
soldier above mentioned had lost many a &ldquo;bunkie,&rdquo; there had
gone on for some time, under the McKinley-Taft peace-at-any-price
policy, whose keynote was that no American should have a job a Filipino
could fill, much appointing to municipal and other offices of
Filipinos, many of whom had at once set to work to make their new
offices useful to the cause of their country by systematic aid to the
ambuscade business. With this and the Balangiga massacre ever in mind,
the men of General Bell&rsquo;s brigade began their work in Batangas in
a mood which quite made for fidelity in performance of orders to
&ldquo;make living unbearable&rdquo; for the Filipino &ldquo;by acts,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name=
"pb392">392</a>]</span>not words.&rdquo; Also, the American soldier can
sing, sometimes very badly, but often rather irrepressibly, until
stopped by his officer. Also, whether justly or unjustly is beside the
question, he considers a politician who pets the enemy in the midst of
a war a hypocrite. So General Bell&rsquo;s 2500 men began that Batangas
campaign on New Year&rsquo;s Day, 1902, giving preference, out of their
repertoire, to a campaign song whose ominous chorus ran:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;He may be a brother of William H. Taft</p>
<p class="line">But he ain&rsquo;t no friend of mine,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">and between songs they would say purringly to one
another, &ldquo;Remember Balangiga.&rdquo; <i>And their commanding
officer was the very incarnation of this feeling.</i> So listen to the
stride of his seven-league boots and the ring of his iron heel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I expect to first clean out the wide Looboo Peninsula.
I shall then move command to the vicinity of Lake Taal, and sweep the
country westward to the ocean and south of Cavite, returning through
Lipa. I shall <i>scour and clean up</i> the Lipa mountains. Swinging
northward, the country in the vicinity of [here follows a long list of
towns] will be <i>scoured</i>, ending at [a named mountain], which will
then be <i>thoroughly searched and devastated</i>. Swinging back to the
right, the same treatment will be given all the country of which [two
named mountains] are the main peaks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so on <i lang="la">ad libitum</i>. General Bell&rsquo;s course
in Batangas was commended in the annual report of his immediate
superior, a very humane, as well as gallant, soldier, General Wheaton,
as &ldquo;a model in suppressing insurrections under like
circumstances.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8831src" href=
"#xd27e8831" name="xd27e8831src">36</a> The Batangas programme was
approved by General Chaffee, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393"
href="#pb393" name="pb393">393</a>]</span>commanding general. In 1902
the United States Senate rang with indiscriminate denunciation of the
Batangas severities and the Samar &ldquo;kill and burn&rdquo; orders. I
tried in 1903, without success, to satisfy my distinguished and beloved
fellow-townsman, Senator Bacon, that at the time it was adopted it had
become a military necessity, which it had. The fact was that the
McKinley-Taft policy of conciliation, intended to gild the rivets of
alien domination and cure the desire for independence by coddling, had
loaned aid and comfort to the enemy, by creating, among a people used
theretofore solely to force as a governmental agency for making
sovereignty respected, the pathetic notion that we were afraid of them,
and might be weakening in respect to our declared programme of denying
them independence. The Bell opinion of the Commission&rsquo;s
confidence in Filipino gladness at its advent among them is
sufficiently apparent in his orders to his troops. On May 23, 1902,
Senator Bacon read in the Senate a letter from an officer of the army,
a West Point graduate and a personal friend of the Senator&rsquo;s,
whose name he withheld, but for whose veracity he vouched, which letter
alluded to &ldquo;a reconcentrado, pen with a dead line outside, beyond
which everything living is shot&rdquo;; spoke of &ldquo;this
corpse-carcass stench wafted in&rdquo; (to where the letter-writer sat
writing) as making it &ldquo;slightly unpleasant here,&rdquo; and made
your flesh crawl thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">At nightfall clouds of vampire bats softly swirl out
on their orgies over the dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This does not sound to me like Batangas and Bell. It sounds like
Smith and Samar. There were about 100,000 people, all told, gathered in
the reconcentrado <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href="#pb394"
name="pb394">394</a>]</span>camps in Batangas under General
Bell,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8846src" href="#xd27e8846" name=
"xd27e8846src">37</a> and they were handled as efficiently as General
Funston handled matters after the San Francisco fire. There was no
starvation in those camps. All the reconcentrados had to do was not to
cross the dead line of the reconcentration zone, and to draw their
rations, which were provided as religiously as any ordinary American
who is not a fiend and has plenty of rice on hand for the purpose will
give it to the hungry. The reconcentrado camps and the people in them
were daily looked after by medical officers of the American army.
General Bell&rsquo;s active campaigning began in Batangas January 1,
1902, Malvar surrendered April 16 thereafter, and Batangas was
thoroughly purged of insurrectos and the like by July. During this
period the total of <span class="corr" id="xd27e8852" title=
"Source: insurgent">insurgents</span> killed was only 163, and wounded
209; and 3626 insurgents surrendered.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8855src" href="#xd27e8855" name="xd27e8855src">38</a></p>
<p>The truth is General Bell&rsquo;s &ldquo;bark&rdquo; was much worse
than his &ldquo;bite.&rdquo; The inestimable value of what he did in
Batangas in 1901&ndash;02 lay in convincing the Filipinos once and for
all that we were not as impotent as the civil-government coddling had
led them quite naturally, but very foolishly, to think we were.
Reference was made above to the fact that the population of Batangas in
1899 was 312,192, and in 1903, 257,715. Those figures were inserted at
the outset to make General Bell&rsquo;s &ldquo;bark&rdquo; sound
louder, but now that we are considering his
&ldquo;bite&rdquo;&mdash;how many lives his Batangas lesson to the
Filipino people cost&mdash;another bit of testimony is tremendously
relevant. On December 18, 1901, the Provincial Secretary of Batangas
Province reported to Governor Taft that the mortality in Batangas
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name=
"pb395">395</a>]</span>due to war, pestilence, and famine &ldquo;has
reduced to a little over 200,000 the more than 300,000 inhabitants
which in former years the province had.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8864src" href="#xd27e8864" name="xd27e8864src">39</a> Considering
that General Bell&rsquo;s 1901&ndash;&rsquo;02 campaign in that
ill-fated province cost outright but 163 killed,&mdash;how many of the
209 wounded recovered does not appear; they may have all
recovered&mdash;the Bell programme in Batangas was indeed a very tender
model, from the humanitarian stand-point, of civilizing with a Krag, a
model of &ldquo;suppressing insurrection under like
circumstances.&rdquo; But it was never again followed. It had made too
much noise at home. Senator Bacon&rsquo;s &ldquo;corpse-carcass
stench&rdquo; from supposed reconcentrado pens and his &ldquo;clouds of
vampire bats softly swirling on their orgies over the dead,&rdquo; so
vividly reminded our people of why they had driven Spain out of Cuba,
that the Administration became apprehensive. Until the noise about the
Batangas business, our people had been led by Governor Taft and
President Roosevelt to believe that the Filipinos were most sobbingly
in love with &ldquo;a benign civil government&rdquo; and had forgotten
all about independence. It was obvious that a repetition of such a
campaign in any other province might create in the public mind at home
a disgust with the whole Philippine policy which would be heard at the
polls in the next presidential election. So the Batangas affair made it
certain that the army was not going to be ordered out again in the
Philippines before said next presidential election, at least; whatever
castigation might be deemed advisable thereafter.</p>
<p>It was intimated above that Senator Bacon&rsquo;s army
friend&rsquo;s &ldquo;clouds of vampire bats softly swirling&rdquo;
over the corpses of reconcentrados, were doing said swirling <i>not</i>
over Batangas at all, but over Samar. Any man familiar with the lay of
the land in the two provinces <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb396"
href="#pb396" name="pb396">396</a>]</span>can see from the letter that
it was written from Samar. Moreover, Colonel Wagner afterwards
testified before the Senate Committee of 1902<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8877src" href="#xd27e8877" name="xd27e8877src">40</a> that if
there had been any great mortality in the reconcentration camps in
Batangas, he would have known of it. He inspected practically all those
Batangas camps. Nobody who was in the islands at the time doubts but
what such conditions may have obtained in some places under General
Smith in Samar, or believes for a moment that any such conditions would
have been tolerated under General Bell. General Bell has that aversion
to either causing or witnessing needless suffering, which you almost
invariably find in men who are both constitutionally brave and
temperamentally generous and considerate of others. But the moral
sought to be pointed here is not that the Bell reconcentration in
Batangas was as merciful as the Smith performances in Samar were
hellish, but that, in all matters concerning the Philippines, the army,
as in the case of Senator Bacon&rsquo;s friend, is gagged by operation
of law, and its enforced silence is peculiarly an asset in the hands of
the party in power seeking to continue in power, in a distant colonial
enterprise. Senator Bacon withheld his friend&rsquo;s name, because for
an army officer to tell the truth about the Philippines would be likely
to get him into trouble with the President of the United States. The
President, be it remembered, is also the leader of the political party
to which he belongs. That is why the country has never been able to get
any light from those who know the most about the Philippines and the
wisdom or unwisdom of keeping them, viz., the army. In 1898 this
republic was beguiled into abandonment of the faiths of the founders
and started after a gold brick, thinking it was a Klondyke. Then and
ever since, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span>the most important and material witnesses
concerning the wisdom or unwisdom of keeping the brick, viz., the
army,&mdash;which best of all knows the rank folly of it&mdash;have
been gagged by operation of law. All republics that have heretofore
become monarchies, have become so through manipulation of the army by
men in power seeking to continue in power. We should either resign our
expensive kingship over the Philippines or get a king for the whole
business, and be done with it. We have some ready-made coronet initials
in T. R.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8884src" href="#xd27e8884" name=
"xd27e8884src">41</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;On June 23, 1902,&rdquo; says General Chaffee, in his report
for that year,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8892src" href="#xd27e8892"
name="xd27e8892src">42</a> &ldquo;by Act No. 421 of the Philippine
Commission, so much of Act No. 173, of July 17, 1901, as transferred
the province of Batangas to military control was revoked. Civil
government was re-established in the province at 12 o&rsquo;clock noon,
July 4, 1902.&rdquo; The rest of the 1,748,573 people herein above
mentioned as constituting the population of Batangas, Cebu, Bohol,
Laguna, Tayabas, and Samar, were also in turn made to &ldquo;want peace
and want it badly,&rdquo; and on July 4, 1902, President Roosevelt
issued his proclamation declaring that a state of general and complete
peace existed. This is the famous proclamation in which he
congratulated General Chaffee and the officers and men of his command
on &ldquo;a total of more than 2000 combats, great and small,&rdquo;
most of them subsequent to the Taft roseate cablegrams of 1900, and the
still more roseate reports of 1901 from the same source. The
proclamation appeared in the Philippines as General Orders No. 66,
Adjutant General&rsquo;s Office, Washington, dated July 4,
1902.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8897src" href="#xd27e8897" name=

Philippines, in the name of the President of the United States, for the
courage and fortitude, the indomitable spirit and loyal devotion with
which they had been fighting up to that time, alluded to the impliedly
lamb-like or turn-the-other-cheek way in which they had been behaving
(no special reference is made either to Batangas, Samar, or the
water-cure), and closes with a bully Rooseveltian war-whoop about the
&ldquo;more than 2000 combats, great and small,&rdquo; above mentioned.
It also referred to how, &ldquo;<i>with admirable good temper</i> and
loyalty to American ideals its (the army&rsquo;s) commanding generals
have joined with the civilian agents of the government&rdquo; in the
work of superinducing allegiance to American sovereignty. This document
is one of the most remarkable state papers of that most remarkable of
men, ex-President Roosevelt, in its evidences of ability to mould
powerful discordant elements to his will. It put everybody in a good
humor. And yet, read at every military post, it served notice on the
military that if they knew which side their bread was buttered on, they
had better forget everything they knew tending to show the prematurity
of the setting-up of the civil government, sheath all tomahawks and
scalping knives they might have whetted and waiting for Governor
Taft&rsquo;s exit from office, abstain from chatty letters to United
States Senators telling tales out of school, such as the one Senator
Bacon had read on the floor of the Senate (already noticed), and
dutifully <i>perceive</i>, in the future, that the war was ended, as
officially announced in the proclamation itself.</p>
<p>The report of the Philippine Commission for 1902, declares that the
insurrection &ldquo;as an organized attempt to subvert the authority of
the United States&rdquo; is over (p. 3). They then proceed, with
evident sincerity, to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href=
"#pb399" name="pb399">399</a>]</span>describe the popularity of
themselves and their policies with the same curious blindness you
sometimes find in your Congressional district, in the type of man who
thinks he could be elected to Congress &ldquo;in a walk&rdquo; if he
should only announce his candidacy, when as a matter of fact, the great
majority of the people of his district are, for some notorious reason
connected with his past history among them,&mdash;say his war
record&mdash;very much prejudiced against him. They repeat one of their
favorite sentiments about the whole country&mdash;always except
&ldquo;as hereinafter excepted&rdquo;&mdash;being now engaged in
<i>enjoying</i> civil government. But they casually admit also that
&ldquo;much remains to be done&rdquo; in suppressing lawlessness and
disturbances, so as to perfect and accentuate said
&ldquo;enjoyment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us see just what the state of the country was in this regard
according to their own showing. They say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The six years of war to which these islands have been
subjected have naturally created a class of restless men utterly
lacking in habits of industry, taught to live and prey upon the country
for their support by the confiscation of food supplies as a war
measure, and regarding the duties of a laborer as dull and impossible
for one who has tasted the excitement of a guerrilla life. Even to the
man anxious to return to agricultural pursuits, the conditions existing
present no temptation. By the war and by the rinderpest, chiefly the
latter, the carabaos, or water-buffaloes, <i>have been reduced to ten
per cent. of their former number</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think of the condition of a country, <i>any</i> country, but
especially one whose wealth is almost wholly agricultural, which has
just had nine tenths of its plow animals absolutely swept off the face
of the earth by war and its immediate consequences. The report
proceeds: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400" name=
"pb400">400</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The chief food of the common people of these islands
is rice, and the carabao is the indispensable instrument of the people
in the cultivation of rice,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>adding also that the carabao is the chief means of transportation of
the tobacco, hemp, and other crops to market, and that the few
remaining carabaos, the ordinary price of which in normal Spanish times
had been $10 was now $100. Then, after completing a faithful picture of
supremely thorough desolation such as the Islands had never seen since
they first rose out of the sea, certainly not during the sleepy,
easy-going Spanish rule, they say: &ldquo;The Filipino people of <i>the
better</i> class have received the passage of the Philippine Act with
great satisfaction&rdquo;&mdash;meaning the Act of Congress of July 1,
1902, the Philippine Government Act. <i lang="de">Gott im Himmel!</i>
What did the people care about paper constitutions concerning
benevolent assimilation? What they were interested in was food and
safety, not politics; food, raiment, shelter, and efficient police
protection from the brigandage which immediately follows in the wake of
all war, not details as to what we were going to do with the bleeding
and prostrate body politic. But the Commission had started out to
govern the Filipino people on a definite theory,&mdash;apparently on
the idea that if Americans wore white duck and no brass buttons, in
lieu of khaki and brass buttons, the Filipinos would at once forget the
war and be happy with an exceeding great happiness. Now the real
situation was this. The Islands had not yet been thoroughly beaten into
submission. Northern Luzon had been conquered. The lake region of
Southern Luzon had been conquered. The most important of the Visayan
Islands had been conquered. But the extreme southern portion of Luzon,
the enormously rich hemp peninsula already described <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name="pb401">401</a>]</span>in a
former chapter, and the adjoining hemp island of Samar, were still
seething with sedition which later broke out. All through the winter of
1900&ndash;01 General MacArthur had tried to get Mr. Root to let him
close the hemp ports. But some powerful influence at Washington had
prevented the grant of this permission. On January 9, 1901, General
MacArthur had wired Mr. Root:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Hemp in southern Luzon in same relation to present
struggle as cotton during rebellion.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e8949src" href="#xd27e8949" name="xd27e8949src">44</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing doing. General MacArthur must worry along with the
&ldquo;blockade-runners&rdquo; as best he could, no matter how much
hemp money might be poured into the insurgent coffers. So that in the
latter part of 1902, although the more respectable of the insurgent
leaders had then surrendered, even in the hemp country, the flames of
public disorder, which had flickered for a spell after the Batangas
lesson, broke out anew in the province of Albay, and in parts of
Sorsogon, the two provinces of the hemp peninsula having the best
sea-ports. The man at the head of this Albay insurrection was a sorry
scamp of some shrewdness by the name of Simeon Ola, with whom I
afterwards had an interesting and in some respects most amusing
acquaintance. But that is another story. I have simply brought the
whole archipelago abreast of the close of 1902, relatively to public
order. In this way only may the insurrections in Albay and elsewhere in
1902&ndash;03, described in the chapter which follows, be understood in
their relation to a comprehensive view of the American occupation from
the beginning, and not be regarded as &ldquo;a local issue&rdquo; like
General Hancock&rsquo;s tariff, having <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb402" href="#pb402" name="pb402">402</a>]</span>no general political
significance. In this way only may those insurrections be understood in
their true relation to the history of public order in the Islands. The
Commission always represented all disturbances after 1902 as matters of
mere banditti, such as have been chronic for generations in Calabria or
the Transcaucasus, wholly distinct from, instead of being an inevitable
political sequel of, the years of continuous warfare which had
preceded. Their benevolent obsession was that the desire of the
Philippine people for independence was wholly and happily eradicated.

<p class="first">Throughout the last year of Governor Taft&rsquo;s
administration in the Philippines, 1903, both he, and the peaceably
inclined Filipinos in the disturbed districts, were between the devil
and the deep sea. The military handling of the Batangas and Samar
disorders of 1901&ndash;2 had precipitated in the United States Senate
a storm of criticism, at the hands of Senator Bacon and others, which
had reminded a public, already satiated with slaughtering a weaker
Christian people they had never seen in the interest of supposed trade
expansion, of &ldquo;the days when Cicero pleaded the cause of Sicily
against Verres, and when, before a senate which still retained some
show of freedom, Tacitus thundered against the oppressor of
Africa.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8973src" href="#xd27e8973"
name="xd27e8973src">1</a> He did not want to order out the military
again if he could help it, and this relegated him to his native

it afterwards turned out,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e8993src" href=
"#xd27e8993" name="xd27e8993src">3</a> for the maintenance of public
order and for affording to the peaceably inclined people that sort of
security for life and property, and that protection against
semi-political as well as unmitigated brigandage, which would comport
with the dignity of this nation. The better class of Filipinos, though
not so enamored of American rule as Governor Taft fondly believed, had
by 1903 about resigned themselves to the inevitable, and would have
liked to see brigandage masquerading under the name of patriotism
stopped by that sort of adequate police protection which was so
obviously necessary in the disturbed and unsettled conditions naturally
consequent upon many years of war, and which they of course realized
could only be afforded by the strong arm of the American army. But they
knew that if the army were ordered out, the burden of proof as to their
own loyalty would at once be shifted to them, by the strenuous agents
of that strenuous institution. The result was a sort of reign of terror
for nearly a year, in 1902&ndash;3, in the richest province of the
whole archipelago, the hemp-producing province of Albay, at the
southern end of Luzon, and also in portions of the province of Misamis.
These conditions had begun in those provinces in 1902, and, not being
promptly checked, because the army was held in leash and the
constabulary were crude and inadequate, by 1903 brigandage therein was
thriving like a garden of weeds. Super-solicitude concerning the
possible effect of adequately vigorous governmental action in the
Philippines on the fortunes of the Administration in charge of the
Federal Government at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href=
"#pb405" name="pb405">405</a>]</span>Washington, an attitude not
surprising in the colonial agents of that Administration, but which, as
we have seen, had been from the beginning, as it must ever be, the
curse of our colonial system, had rendered American sovereignty in the
disturbed districts as humiliatingly impotent as senile decadence ever
rendered Spain.</p>
<p>The average American citizen will admit that the average American
statesman, even if he be not far-sighted, looks at least a year ahead,
in matters where both his personal fortunes and those of the political
party to which he belongs are intimately related to what he may be
doing at the time. If in 1903 Governor Taft&rsquo;s administration of
affairs in the Philippines was wholly uninfluenced by any possible
effect it might have on President Roosevelt&rsquo;s chances for
becoming an elected President in 1904, then he was a false friend and a
very poor party man as well. Assuming that he was neither, let us
examine his course regarding the disturbances of public order in the
Philippines in that year, as related to the first and most sacred duty
of every government, adequate protection for life and property.</p>
<p>In President McKinley&rsquo;s original instructions of April 7,
1900, to the Taft Commission, after quoting the final paragraph of the
articles of capitulation of the city of Manila:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">This city, its inhabitants *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and its
private property of all descriptions *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* are hereby placed
under the special safeguard of the faith and honor of the American
army;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the President had added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">As high and sacred an obligation rests upon the
Government of the United States to give <i>protection for property and
life</i> *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* <i>to all the people of the Philippine
Islands</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name=
"pb406">406</a>]</span></p>
<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* <i>I charge this Commission to labor for the full
performance of this obligation, which concerns the honor and conscience
of their country.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will probably never again have a better man at the head of the
Philippine Government than William H. Taft. We have no higher type of
citizen in the republic to-day than the man now<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9025src" href="#xd27e9025" name="xd27e9025src">4</a> at the head
of it. In the <i>Outlook</i> of September 21, 1901, there appeared an
article on the Philippines written in the summer previous by
Vice-President Roosevelt, entitled &ldquo;The First Civil
Governor,&rdquo; which began as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">A year ago a man of wide acquaintance both with
American public life and American public men<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9034src" href="#xd27e9034" name="xd27e9034src">5</a> remarked
that the first Governor of the Philippines ought to combine the
qualities which would make a first-class President of the United States
with the qualities which would make a first-class Chief Justice of the
United States, and that the only man he knew who possessed all these
qualities was Judge William H. Taft, of Ohio. The statement was
entirely correct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The writer subscribed then, and still subscribes, to the foregoing
estimate of Mr. Taft, whether Colonel Roosevelt still does or not.
Though I dissent most vigorously from more than one of President
Taft&rsquo;s policies, and though this book is one long dissent from
his chief pet policy, still it is to me an especial pleasure to do him
honor where I may, not merely because he has greatly honored me in the
past, but because my judgment approves the above estimate. Though as a
party leader he is a very poor general, as Chief Magistrate of the
nation he has certainly deserved and commanded the cordial esteem of
the whole country, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407"
name="pb407">407</a>]</span>and the respectful regard of all mankind.
With this admission freely made, if after reading what follows in this
and the next chapter, and weighing the same in the light of all that
has preceded, the reader does not decide that the writer, far from
being animated by any intelligent high purpose, is merely a foolish
person of the sounding-brass-and-tinkling-cymbal variety full of sound
and fury signifying nothing, then he can reach but one other
conclusion, viz., that colonization by a republic like ours, such as
that we blundered into by purchasing the Philippines, is a case of a
house divided against itself, a case of the soul of a nation at war
with the better angels of its nature, a case where considerations of
what may be demanded by home considerations of political expediency
will always operate to the detriment of the Filipino people, and be the
controlling factor in our government of them. And if I show that in the
Philippines in 1903 Governor Taft failed properly to protect the lives
and property of peaceably inclined people, as so sacredly enjoined in
the language above quoted from President McKinley&rsquo;s original
instructions to him, lest &ldquo;the full performance of this
obligation&rdquo; might prejudice the presidential prospects of his
friend, Mr. Roosevelt, and the success of the party to which they
belonged, then I will have shown that for this republic to be in the
colonizing business is an absolutely evil thing, and that any man who
proposes any honorable way out of the conceded blunder of 1898, is
entitled to a hearing at the hands of the American people, because it
&ldquo;concerns the honor and conscience of their country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having tried most of the cases which arose out of the public
disorders in the Philippines in 1903, and knowing from what I thus
learned, together with what I subsequently learned <i>which Mr. Taft
knew then</i>, that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href=
"#pb408" name="pb408">408</a>]</span>most serious of those disorders
were very inadequately handled by native police, and constabulary, with
much wholly unnecessary incidental sacrifice of life, in order to
preserve the appearance of &ldquo;civil&rdquo; government and convey
the impression of the state of peace the name implied, at a time when a
reign of terror due to brigandage prevailed throughout wide and
populous regions in whose soil lay the riches of agricultural plenty,
while the United States Army looked on with a silent disgust which
understood the reason, and a becoming subordination which regretfully
bowed to that reason as one which must ever be the curse of
colonization by a republic like ours, I know whereof I shall speak, and
will therefore speak neither lightly nor unadvisedly, but soberly,
charitably, and in the fear of God.</p>
<p>The insurrection in the Philippines against American authority which
began with the outbreak of February 4, 1899, and whose last dying
embers were not finally stamped out until 1906, systematic denials by
optimist officialdom to the contrary notwithstanding, had three
distinct stages:</p>
<p>(1) The original fighting in company, battalion, and regimental
formation, with the ordinary wide-flung battle line; this having
terminated pursuant to a preconcerted plan early in November, 1899.</p>
<p>(2) A period of guerrilla warfare maintained by the educated,
patriotic, fighting generals, in a gradually decreasing number of
provinces, until the summer of 1902.</p>
<p>(3) The final long drawn-out sputterings, which began to get serious
in the fall of 1902, in provinces prematurely taken under the civil
government, and stripped of adequate military protection before things
had been given time to settle down in them to normal.</p>
<p>These last are the &ldquo;gardens of weeds&rdquo;&mdash;brigandage
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409" name=
"pb409">409</a>]</span>weeds&mdash;above mentioned. While the
horticultural metaphor will help some, to really understand the case
nothing so fits it as the more common illustration applied to grave
public disorders having a common cause which likens such matters to a
conflagration. The third and last stage through which the Philippine
insurrection degenerated to final extinction is adequately and
accurately described in the following extract from one of the military
reports of 1902:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The surrender or capture of the respectable military
element left the control of affairs and the remainder of the arms in
the hands of a lot of persons, most of them ignorant, some criminal,
and nearly all pertaining to a restless, irresponsible, unscrupulous
class of people, whose principal ambition seems to be to live without
work, and who have found it possible to so do under the guise of
patriotism.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9065src" href="#xd27e9065" name=
"xd27e9065src">6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was the problem which confronted Governor Taft in 1903 as to
public order and protection of the peaceably inclined people, in the
two main provinces hereinafter dealt with.</p>
<p>It is a great pity that in 1903 President Roosevelt could not have
called in Secretary of War Root and sent for Senator Bacon, and those
of the latter&rsquo;s colleagues whose philippics in the Senate of the
year previous against Generals Jake Smith and J. Franklin Bell had
reminded an aroused nation of the days of Cicero and Verres, Tacitus
and Africa, etc., and had a frank talk with them somewhat after this
fashion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Gentlemen, Governor Taft has a hard job out there in
the Philippines. There is a big insurrection going on in the province
of Albay, which is the very richest province in the whole archipelago,
a province as big as the State of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb410"
href="#pb410" name="pb410">410</a>]</span>Delaware,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e9079src" href="#xd27e9079" name="xd27e9079src">7</a> having a
population of about a quarter of a million people, and he has, for
police purposes, a crude outfit of native constabulary, officered
mostly by ex-enlisted men of the mustered-out American volunteer
regiments. The personnel of the officers may be weeded out later and
made a fine body of men, but just at present there are a good many
rather tough citizens among them. Moreover, as soon as the constabulary
was gotten together they were at once set to work chasing little
remnants of the insurgent army all over the archipelago. So as yet they
are as undisciplined an outfit as you can well imagine, and have never
had any opportunity to act together in any considerable command.
Moreover, hardly any Filipinos have yet had a chance to learn much
about how to shoot a rifle. Also, they know practically nothing about
the interior economy of large commands, such as handling and
distributing rations systematically for troops and for prisoners, or
doing the same as to clothing, and nothing at all about medical care of
the wounded, or the sick, or prisoners. So you can see that to handle
this insurrection with such an outfit as this is sure to mean trouble
of one sort or another. Wholly unauthorized overtures through officious
natives, to the insurgent brigand chiefs, may, possibly, be made,
promising them immunity, when they ought to be made an example of; and
that will embarrass us in punishing them when we do finally get them,
and be an encouragement to other cut-throats to do likewise in the
future. Worst of all, you can see that if some five hundred or a
thousand of these brigands, or insurgents, or whatever they are,
suddenly surrender, the ordinary police accommodations for housing and
feeding prisoners will be wholly inadequate; yet we will have to detain
them all until our courts can sift them and see which are the mere dumb
driven cattle and which are the mischievous fellows. Therefore, in case
of such a surrender, the nature of this constabulary force, as I have
already described it to you, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb411" href=
"#pb411" name="pb411">411</a>]</span>makes it plain that its inadequacy
to meet the serious conditions we are now confronted with may result in
our having on our hands a series of little Andersonville prisons that
will smell to heaven. The majority of the people of the province are
really sick of the war. Their best men have all surrendered and come
in. But there is an ignorant creature calling himself a general, by the
name of Ola, who seems to have a great deal of influence with the
lawless element that do not want to work. Ola has gathered together
nearly a thousand malcontents, who obey him implicitly. He is
terrorizing Albay province and the regions adjacent thereto, and as the
constabulary are not adequate to patrol the whole province, the people
do not know whether self-interest demands that they should side with
Ola or with us. Clearly, therefore, this is a case for vigorous
measures, if we all have a common concern for the national honor, for
the maintenance of law and order in a territory we are supposed to be
governing, and for the proper protection of life and property there.
General Bell or somebody else ought to be sent there to comb that
province just as Bell did Batangas. But we don&rsquo;t want any howl
about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point of the supposed colloquy,&mdash;I say
&ldquo;colloquy,&rdquo; though tradition has it that most of President
Roosevelt&rsquo;s &ldquo;colloquys&rdquo; with Senators were what Henry
E. Davis, the Sidney Smith of Washington, calls &ldquo;unilateral
conversation&rdquo;&mdash;one can imagine the senatorial Ciceros
exchanging glances expressive of the unspoken thought: &ldquo;The man
certainly has his nerve with him. Does he think the Senate is an annex
of the White House?&rdquo; Then we can imagine President Roosevelt
bending strenuously to his task with infinite tactfulness thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I put Jake Smith out of business, as you gentlemen all
know, for his inhuman methods of avenging the Balangiga <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb412" href="#pb412" name=
"pb412">412</a>]</span>massacre in Samar, and I am just as much opposed
to cruelty as any of you Senators can be. But Bell in Batangas is an
altogether different case from Smith in Samar. All this about the odor
of decomposing bodies wafted from reconcentration camps, and
&ldquo;clouds of vampire bats swirling out on their orgies over the
dead,&rdquo; that Senator Bacon&rsquo;s army friend, whoever he may be,
wrote the Senator, relates to Samar, and never did have any application
to Bell&rsquo;s methods in Batangas. Bell did a clean job in a minimum
of time and with a minimum sacrifice of life, and, while he did have
those reconcentration camps in Batangas, he saw to it religiously that
nobody starved, and that all those people received daily medical
treatment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the correctness of the picture of conditions presented in the
above hypothetical talk, I of course intend to be understood as
vouching. If such a talk could have been had in 1903 by President
Roosevelt with Senator Bacon and those of his colleagues who shared his
views, the Albay situation might have been handled creditably. But the
Administration was in no position to be frank with the Opposition. No
Administration has ever yet during the last fourteen years been in a
position to be frank with the Senate and the country concerning the
situation at any given time in the Philippines, because at any given
time there was always so much that it could not afford to re-open and
explain. Mr. Root, for instance, might have been questioned too closely
as to why, when Secretary of War, he had gone around the country in the
fall of 1900 speaking for Mr. McKinley, and talking about &ldquo;<i>the
patient and unconsenting millions&rdquo; so anxious to be rid of
&ldquo;Aguinaldo and his band of assassins</i>,&rdquo; when at that
very time his (Mr. Root&rsquo;s) generals in the Philippines were
engaged in activities, the magnitude of which may be inferred from a
telegram sent from Washington to General <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb413" href="#pb413" name="pb413">413</a>]</span>Wood at Havana,
asking if he could possibly spare the 10th Infantry, and adding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>Imperative that we have immediate use of every
available company that we can lay our hands on for service in the
Philippines</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9105src" href="#xd27e9105"
name="xd27e9105src">8</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>although at West Point in 1902 he told the cadets how nobly the army
had labored in putting down &ldquo;an insurrection of 7,000,000
people.&rdquo; No, the Administration in 1903 simply could not afford
to be frank concerning the situation in the Philippines. I need not
recapitulate here any more of the long train of reasons why, because
they have all been fully explained in the preceding chapters. Of course
President Roosevelt had no such guilty knowledge of the facts as Mr.
Root. He was not in constant daily contact with army officers at the
War Department, familiar with the actual situation in the Philippines,
as Mr. Root was. He was simply &ldquo;sticking to Taft.&rdquo;
Somewhere along about the time the military folk in the Philippines
were scoffing at the unnecessary sacrifice of life incident to the lack
of a strong government, President Roosevelt had written his warm
personal friend, Hon. George Curry, now a member of Congress from New
Mexico, who had been a captain in his regiment before Santiago, was
then an official of the civil government of the Philippines, and later
Governor of New Mexico, by appointment of Mr. Roosevelt: &ldquo;Stick
to Taft, George&rdquo; or words to that effect. Mr. Roosevelt&rsquo;s
attitude was simply that of an intensely loyal friend of Mr. Taft who
simply assumed that the Philippine Government was not going to tolerate
impotence in the matter of protecting life and property. But everybody
at both ends of the line was too deep in the mire of all the long and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href="#pb414" name=
"pb414">414</a>]</span>systematic withholding of facts from the
American public which had been occurring ever since 1898, and which it
has been the aim of the preceding chapters to illuminate by the light
since <span class="corr" id="xd27e9114" title=
"Source: become">becoming</span> available in the published official
records of the Government. Hence, in the hypothetical conference above
supposed, President Roosevelt was in no position to take any high
ground. He would have had to admit that the civil government of 1901
was set up too soon in order to stand by half-baked notions dished out
in 1900 by the Taft Commission in aid of his own and Mr.
McKinley&rsquo;s campaign for the Presidency and Vice-Presidency,
respectively. In other words the truth about the Philippines from the
beginning might, and probably would, have seriously jeopardized the
Roosevelt presidential chances in 1904. So Governor Taft was left to
his own resources in struggling with the problem of law and order in
the Islands, intimately understanding the obvious bearing, just
suggested, of what he might do out there, on the election of 1904. What
then did Governor Taft do to meet the situation in 1903? Chronological
order, as well as other considerations making for clearness, would
suggest that I begin by telling what he did not do.</p>
<p>In May, 1903, I was sent to the province of Surigao to try some
cases arising out of what has ever since been known in that
out-of-the-way region as &ldquo;the affair of March 23d&rdquo; (1903).
In his annual report for 1903, pages 29 and 30, in describing the
Surigao affair, Governor Taft correctly states that a band of outlaws
came into the town of Surigao on the day above named, killed Captain
Clark, the officer in charge of the constabulary, took the
constabulary&rsquo;s guns, while they were all away at their mid-day
meal, scattered about the town, and departed. But Mr. Taft&rsquo;s
report <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415" name=
"pb415">415</a>]</span>disposes of the whole incident in a most casual
way. As a matter of fact the gist of it was that a heroic little band
of Americans under Mr. Luther S. Kelly, the provincial treasurer, an
old Indian scout of the Yellowstone country, hastily gathered the seven
American women then in the town, one of them in a delicate condition,
into the stone government house, and stood off those semi-civilized
sensual brigands until reinforcements arrived. Governor Taft&rsquo;s
failure adequately to present the gravity of the episode in his account
of it does not argue well for the subsequent solicitude he might feel
about other American women in other remote provinces which he was
anxious to keep on his &ldquo;pacified list,&rdquo; to say nothing of
politically negligible native life therein.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e9121src" href="#xd27e9121" name="xd27e9121src">9</a> Nor does
this report include any of the material facts showing the
ineffectiveness of the rank and file of the constabulary to cope with
the situation, or the general feeling of insecurity I found in the
province as to how far the whole population might be in sympathy with
the brigands. As a matter of fact, after that Surigao affair, Governor
Taft had to turn the army loose in the province to go and get back and
restore to his constabulary the seventy-five to one hundred
stand-of-arms the brigands had so rudely and impolitely taken away from
them, and I held court there for a month trying the people who were
captured and brought in, with Colonel Meyer, of the 11th Infantry, one
of the most thorough and able soldiers of the United States Army, and
seven hundred soldiers of his regiment acting as deputy sheriffs, and
yet all the time the province was under &ldquo;civil&rdquo; government,
nominally. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416" name=
"pb416">416</a>]</span>Colonel Meyer got the men who killed Clark, and,
upon due and ample proof, I hung them, but Surigao was never taken for
a day from the list of provinces enjoying &ldquo;the peace and
protection of a benign civil government.&rdquo; <i>The writ of habeas
corpus was never suspended for a moment.</i></p>
<p>In the report above quoted from, Governor Taft remarks that if the
prompt steps he did take (he had already described the prompt sending
of the military to the scene) had not been taken, &ldquo;the trouble
might have spread.&rdquo; But the Surigao affair seemed to teach the
civil government nothing in the matter of subsequent protection of
life, nor did it lessen their persistence in relying on their
constabulary for due extension of such protection in time of need.</p>
<p>By June, 1903, another scheme was invented for avoiding calling on
the military. When you are in a foreign country building a new
government on the ruins of an old one, you naturally find out as much
as you can about how the old one met its problems. The Spaniards had
had the same problem in their day about not ordering out the military,
because they did not have any military to order out. They were too poor
to garrison the various provinces. They had long followed the plan,
from time to time, of reconcentrating in the main towns of disturbed
districts all the country population they could get to come in, and
then acting on the assumption that all who did not come in were public
enemies. This meant that when the country people came in, they simply
looked out for themselves, while away from their homes, and farms, as
best they could. Of course nobody at all looked after the farms, and
nobody provided medical attention for the reconcentrados, or sanitary
attention for the reconcentration camps. This general plan was formally
sanctioned by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417" name=
"pb417">417</a>]</span>the Commission, in so far as the following law
sanctioned it. The law was enacted, June 1, 1903. It is section 6, of
Act 781, which was an act dealing with all the constabulary problems,
of which this was one. It read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">In provinces which are <i>infested to such an extent
with ladrones or outlaws that the lives and property of residents in
the outlying barrios<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9141src" href=
"#xd27e9141" name="xd27e9141src">10</a> are rendered wholly insecure by
continued predatory raids</i>&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>think of permitting a country to get into any such condition when
you have an abundance of American troops on hand available to prevent
it&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">and such outlying barrios thus furnish to the ladrones
or outlaws their sources of food supply, <i>and it is not possible with
the available police forces constantly to provide protection to such
barrios</i>&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>there being all the time &ldquo;available police forces,&rdquo; in
the shape of regular troops, amply able to handle these unsettled
conditions, which were the inevitable aftermath of lawlessness
consequent on five or six years of guerrilla warfare&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">it shall be within the power of the Governor-General,
upon resolution of the Philippine Commission, to authorize the
provincial governor to order that the residents of such outlying
barrios be temporarily brought&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>observe the length of time this may last is not limited&mdash;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href="#pb418" name=
"pb418">418</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">within stated proximity to the <i>poblacion</i>, or
larger barrios, of the municipality, there to remain until the
necessity for such order ceases to exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To house and ration the reconcentrados, the following provision is
made by the statute we are considering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">During such <i>temporary</i> residence, it shall be
the duty of the provincial board, out of provincial funds, to furnish
such sustenance and shelter as may be needed to prevent suffering among
the residents of the barrios thus withdrawn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The act also provides that during the course of the reconcentration,
where the province does not happen to have the necessary ready cash, it
may apply to the Commission, in distant Manila, for an appropriation to
meet the emergency. What is to be done with those who starve during the
temporary deficit, it does not say. If you must have reconcentration,
to leave it to such agencies as the above, with the native police and
constabulary as understudies, in lieu of availing yourself of the
superb equipment of the American army, with all its facilities for
handling great masses of people, as they did, for instance, after the
San Francisco fire, is like preferring the Mulligan Guards to the
Cold-stream Guards. Furthermore, there is no escape from the logic of
the fact that reconcentration is essentially a war measure. The
difference between what is lawful in war and what is lawful in peace is
not a technical one. In war the innocent must often suffer with the
guilty. In peace the theory at least is that only the guilty suffer.
Hence it is that our Constitution is so jealous that in time of peace
no man&rsquo;s life, liberty, or property, shall be taken from him
without &ldquo;due process of law,&rdquo; a provision which becomes
inoperative in war times, being superseded by martial law. I know that
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name=
"pb419">419</a>]</span>early question, &ldquo;Does the Constitution
follow the flag?&rdquo; was answered by the Supreme Court of the United
States in the negative as to the Philippines. But the Act of Congress
of July 1, 1902, under which we were governing the Philippines in 1903,
and still govern them, known as the Philippine Government Act, extended
to the Islands all the provisions of the Bill of Rights of our
Constitution except the right of jury trial and the individual right to
go armed&mdash;&ldquo;bear arms.&rdquo; It specifically said in section
5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">No law shall be enacted in said Islands which shall
deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of
law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It hardly needs argument to show that to bundle the rural population
of a whole district out of house and home, and make them come to town
to live indefinitely on such public charity as may drain through the
itching fingers of impecunious town officials, abandoning meantime
their growing crops, and the household effects they cannot bring with
them, is depriving people of their property, and restraining them of
their liberty, without due process of law. In fact, in 1905, in the
case of Barcelon <i>vs.</i> Baker, vol. v., <i>Philippine Report</i>,
page 116, during an insurrection in Batangas, to control which, the
presidential election of 1904 being then safely over, the writ of
habeas corpus had been suspended and martial law declared, the Supreme
Court of the Philippines held that detention of people as
reconcentrados under such circumstances &ldquo;for the purpose of
protecting them&rdquo; was not an illegal restraint of their liberty,
<i>because the ordinary law had been suspended</i>. This decision held
it to be both the prerogative and the duty of the Governor-General to
suspend <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href="#pb420" name=
"pb420">420</a>]</span>the writ of habeas corpus when the public safety
so required.</p>
<p>I refuse to believe for a moment that President Taft, the former
wise and just judge, in whom is now vested by law the mighty power of
filling vacancies on the highest court in this great country of ours,
will seriously contend that that reconcentration law is not in direct
violation of the above quoted section of the Act of Congress of July 1,
1902, for the government of the Philippines, and therefore null and
void. The truth is, it was a piece of careless legislation, dealing
with conditions that were essentially war conditions, under a
government which was forever vowing that peace conditions existed, and
determined not to admit the contrary. The civil government was like
Lot&rsquo;s wife. It could not look back.</p>
<p>The Act of Congress of 1902 had made the usual provision permitting
the governor to declare martial law in a given locality in his
discretion. But the reconcentration law passed by the Philippine
Commission was a way of avoiding the exercise of that authority, so as
to keep up the appearance of peace in the provinces to which it might
be applied, regardless of how many lives it might cost. In its last
analysis the reconcentration law was at once an admission of a duty to
order out the military and a declaration of intention to neglect that
duty. I suppose the eminent gentlemen who enacted it justified it on
the idea of teaching the natives how to maintain order themselves by
letting them stew in the dregs of their own insurrection. Yet no one
can read the Commission&rsquo;s own description of the widespread
lawlessness which so long ran riot after the guerrilla warfare
degenerated into brigandage, without seeing, from their own showing,
how obvious was their duty to have waited, originally, until law and
order <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href="#pb421" name=
"pb421">421</a>]</span>were restored, by not interfering with the war
itself until it was over, and by keeping the country properly
garrisoned for a decorous and sufficient period after it <i>was</i>
over, until something like real peace conditions should exist, on which
to begin the work of post-bellum reconstruction. After all, it all gets
us back to the original pernicious programme outlined in President
McKinley&rsquo;s annual message to Congress of December, 1899, wherein
was announced the intention to send out the Taft Commission, which
message also announced, in effect, that it was Mr. McKinley&rsquo;s
purpose to begin the work of reconstruction as fast as the patient and
unconsenting millions &ldquo;loyal to our rule&rdquo; should be rescued
from the clutch of the hated Tagals.</p>
<p>Recurring again to the reconcentration law itself, the moral quality
of executive action putting it in operation was not unlike that which
would attach should the Governor of Massachusetts, in lieu of ordering
the state troops to the scene of great strike riots in half a dozen
towns around Boston, issue a proclamation something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The situation has grown so serious that your local
police force, as you see, is wholly inadequate to cope with the
situation. You will all, therefore, thrust your tooth-brushes,
night-gowns, and a change of clothing, into the family grip, and
assemble on the Boston Common and in the public gardens, there to
remain until the necessity for this order ceases to exist, and we will
there take the best care of you we can, as was done in the case of the
San Francisco fire. As governor I am unwilling to order out the
military.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If any lawyer on the Commission gave any thought at the time to the
validity of the reconcentration law, in its relation to the &ldquo;due
process of law&rdquo; clause of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb422" href="#pb422" name="pb422">422</a>]</span>Philippine Government
Act, which none of them probably did, he must simply have justified the
means by the benevolence of the end, on the idea that he knew so much
better than Congress possibly could, the needs of the local situation.
But if you read this law in the light of a knowledge of its practical
operation, there is more suggestion between its lines of Senator
Bacon&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s &ldquo;corpse-carcass stench&rdquo; and
&ldquo;clouds of vampire bats softly swirling out on their orgies over
the dead&rdquo; than there is of benevolence. It really was
unsportsmanlike for the Commission to have entrusted reconcentration to
the native police and constabulary the native governors had, and it was
wholly indefensible for them to take the liberty of violating an act of
Congress in order to live up to their pet fiction about the war being
&ldquo;entirely over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the term of court at Surigao in the month of May, 1903, I was
sent to Misamis province, where I remained until September, handling an
insurrection down there. This province also was nominally in a state of
peace, <i>i.e.</i>, there was no formal recognition of the existence of
the insurrection by suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. Curiously
enough, as I wrote Governor Taft afterwards, the Misamis crowd of
disturbers of the peace were genuine <i>insurrectos</i>. Their movement
was not so formidable as the Ola insurrection in Albay I dealt with
later, but they were by no means unmitigated cut-throats. I have often
wondered how they managed to be so respectable at that late date. They
did not steal, as did most of the outlaws of 1903. Their avowed purpose
was to subvert the existing government. The use of this word
&ldquo;insurrection&rdquo; in connection with these various
disturbances recalls a pertinent incident. In 1904 there was a vacancy
on the Supreme Bench of the Islands. Some of my friends, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name=
"pb423">423</a>]</span>members of the bar of my district, got up a
petition to the then Governor-General setting forth in most partial
terms my alleged qualifications for the place. Now in the Philippines,
in the candor of informal social intercourse, all of us always called a
spade a spade, <i>i.e.</i>, we called an insurrection an insurrection,
instead of referring to the disturbance in the guarded and euphemistic
terms which you find in all the official reports intended for home
consumption. So in their petition, these gentlemen recited, among my
other supposed qualifications, that I had held court in three different
provinces &ldquo;during insurrections in the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Albay insurrection was the worst one I had to deal with during
Governor Taft&rsquo;s administration as Governor of the Philippines.
This was the insurrection headed by Simeon Ola. The first appearance of
this man Ola in the official reports of the Philippine Government in
connection with the Albay disturbances of 1902&ndash;3 is in the report
of the colonel commanding the constabulary for the district which
included Albay, Col. H. H. Bandholtz, dated June 30, 1903.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9242src" href="#xd27e9242" name=
"xd27e9242src">11</a> This report contains a sort of diary of events
for the year preceding the date of it. An entry for October 28, 1902,
begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Early this month <i>negotiations</i> were opened with
Simeon Ola, chief of the ladrones in this province, with a view of
inducing him to surrender.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think of this great government <i>negotiating</i> with the leader of
a band of thieves who were openly and flagrantly defying its authority!
The entry proceeds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">After many promises and conferences extending over a
period of forty days, during which hostilities were suspended,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb424" href="#pb424" name=
"pb424">424</a>]</span>Ola <i>broke off negotiations</i> and withdrew
his entire force and <i>a large number of additional recruits that he
had secured during the armistice</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before Ola finally surrendered he is supposed to have had a total
command ranging at various times from a thousand to 1500 men. And I
think Colonel Bandholtz must have had in the field opposed to him,
first and last, at least an equal number of native forces. Ola also
makes an official reappearance in the report of the Governor of Albay
Province for 1904.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9273src" href=
"#xd27e9273" name="xd27e9273src">12</a> It there appears that
reconcentration was begun in Albay as part of the campaign against Ola
and his forces, in March, 1903, and continued until the end of October
of that year. Says this report of the Governor of Albay concerning
reconcentration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Naturally, the effect of this <i>unusual volume of
persons</i> in a limited area was disease and suffering for want of
food and ordinary living accommodations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Governor does not say how large the &ldquo;unusual volume of
persons&rdquo; was that was herded into the reconcentration zones, nor
does he furnish any mortality statistics. <i>Nobody kept any.</i> How
much there was of the awful mortality and &ldquo;clouds of vampire bats
softly swirling out on their orgies over the dead,&rdquo; that Senator
Bacon&rsquo;s army friend correspondent encountered in Samar does not
affirmatively appear. The number of people affected by reconcentration
in Albay and an adjacent province that caught the contagion of unrest
and had to be given similar treatment, was about 300,000.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9290src" href="#xd27e9290" name=
"xd27e9290src">13</a></p>
<p>In his report for 1903, in describing the Ola insurrection
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href="#pb425" name=
"pb425">425</a>]</span>of 1902&ndash;3, Governor Taft says: &ldquo;A
reign of terror was inaugurated throughout the province.&rdquo; He then
goes on to state that to meet it he applied the reconcentration
tactics. In the same report he describes what is to my mind the most
humiliating incident connected with the whole history of the American
Government in the Philippines, viz., Vice-Governor Wright&rsquo;s visit
to Albay in 1903, apparently in pursuance of the peace-at-any-price
policy that the Manila Government was bent on. Governor Taft says of
the civil government&rsquo;s dealings with His Excellency, the
Honorable Simeon Ola, the chief of the brigands, that General Wright
and Dr. Pardo de Tavera, a Filipino member of the Commission, went down
to Albay and &ldquo;talked to the people,&rdquo; the idea apparently
being that those poor unarmed or ill-armed creatures should go after
the brigands. This was to avoid ordering out the military, and
summarily putting a stop to the reign of terror as became the dignity
of this nation. I think these talks had something to do with the origin
of the charge afterwards made that immunity was promised Ola and the
men who finally did surrender with him. Of course General Wright made
no such promises. But the idea got out in the province that the word
was, &ldquo;Get the guns,&rdquo; the inference being that if Ola and
his people would come in and surrender their guns they would be lightly
dealt with. In his book <i>Our Philippine Problem</i>, Professor
Willis, at page 140, gives what purports to be an agreement signed by
Colonel Bandholtz, dated September 22, 1903, whereby Bandholtz promises
Ola immunity, and also promises a number of other things which are on
their face rankly preposterous. Ola was much on the witness stand
before me during that term of court, and, everything &ldquo;came out in
the wash.&rdquo; He was represented by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb426" href="#pb426" name="pb426">426</a>]</span>competent,
intelligent, and fearless Filipino counsel, and they did not suggest
the existence of any such document. No proof of any offer of immunity
was adduced before me. I think Ola simply finally decided to throw
himself on the mercy of the government, on the idea that there would be
more joy over the one sinner that repenteth than over the ninety and
nine that are already saved. He was probably as much afraid that
Governor Taft <i>would</i> order out the military as the wretched
<i>pacificos</i> were that he would not. He immediately turned
state&rsquo;s evidence against all the men under him of whose
individual actings and doings he had any knowledge, the prosecuting
attorney making, with my full approval, a promise to ask executive
clemency as a reward. This was in keeping with the practice in like
cases customary in all jurisdictions throughout the English-speaking
world.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the Ola insurrection may be somewhat appreciated
from the financial loss it occasioned. Says Governor Taft, in his
report for 1903:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The Governor [of Albay] estimates that hemp production
and sale have been interfered with to the extent of some ten to twelve
millions of dollars Mexican [which is equivalent to five or six million
dollars American money<span class="corr" id="xd27e9315" title=
"Not in source">]</span>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e9318src" href=
"#xd27e9318" name="xd27e9318src">14</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the population of the province was about 250,000,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e9325src" href="#xd27e9325" name=
"xd27e9325src">15</a> a loss of $5,000,000 meant a loss of $20 per
capita for the six months or so of reconcentration during which the
farms were neglected. This would be equivalent to a loss of
$1,800,000,000, in the same length of time to a country having a
population of 90,000,000, which is the total population figure for the
United States according to the Census of 1910. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href="#pb427" name="pb427">427</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was in the latter part of October, 1903, I believe, that Ola
finally surrendered with some five hundred or six hundred men. I was
sent to Albay about the middle of November, to assist the regular judge
of the district, Hon. Adam C. Carson, now one of the justices of the
Supreme Court of the Philippines, in disposing of the case arising out
of the Ola performances. Conditions at the time were also very much
perturbed in various neighboring and other provinces, and the courts
and constabulary were kept very busy.</p>
<p>An incident recurs to memory just here which illustrates the state
of public order. But before relating it a decent respect to the
opinions of the reader requires me to state my own attitude toward that
whole situation at the time. I am perfectly clear in my own mind that
as society stands at present, capital punishment is a necessary part of
any sensible scheme for its protection. I have no compunction about
hanging any man for the lawless taking of the life of another. We owe
it to the community as a measure of protection to your life and mine
and all others. So far as public order was concerned in the country now
under consideration in 1903, the &ldquo;civil&rdquo; government was
simply a well-meaning sham, a military government with a civil name to
it. When the constabulary would get in the various brigands,
cut-throats, etc., who might be terrorizing a given district, some of
them masquerading as patriots, others not even doing that, the courts
would try them. None of the judges cared anything about any particular
brigand in any given case except to find out how many, if any, murders,
rapes, arsons, etc., he had committed during the particular reign of
terror of which he had been a part. Wherever specific murders were
proven, the punishment would always be &ldquo;a life for a life.&rdquo;
And you have no idea how absolutely wanton some of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb428" href="#pb428" name="pb428">428</a>]</span>the
murders were, and how cruelly some of the young women, daughters of the
farmers, were maltreated after they were carried off to the mountains.
I would hate to try to guess how much more of this sort of thing would
have had to occur in Albay in 1903 than did occur, to have moved
Governor Taft to deprive Albay of &ldquo;the protection of a benign
civil government&rdquo;&mdash;one of the pet expressions of
contemporaneous official literature&mdash;and say the word to the army
to take hold of the situation and give the people decent protection.
But to come to the incident above broached. Shortly after I reached
Albay, and set to work to hold Part II. of the district court, while my
colleague, Judge Carson, held Part I. we had a call from a third judge,
Judge Linebarger, of Chicago, who was on his way to some other
perturbed region. I think that by that time, late in November, 1903,
Governor Taft must have known he was soon to leave the Islands to
become Secretary of War, and therefore was anxious to be able to make
the best showing possible, in his farewell annual report as Governor,
as to the &ldquo;tranquillity&rdquo; conditions. At any rate Judge
Linebarger came to see us, for a few hours, his ship having touched en
route at the port near the provincial capital of Albay. Judge Carson
had had a gallows erected near the public square of the town, for the
execution of some brigand he had convicted, whether it was for
maltreating some poor farmer&rsquo;s daughter until she died, or
burying an American alive, or what, I do not now recollect. But in
going around the town some one suggested, as we passed this gallows,
that we go up on it to get the view. So we went&mdash;the three of us.
Then each looked at the other and all thought of the work ahead. Then
Judge Carson smiled and dispelled the momentary sombreness by repeating
with grim humor, an old Latin quotation <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb429" href="#pb429" name="pb429">429</a>]</span>he happened to
remember from his college days at the University of Virginia: <i lang=
"la">H&aelig;c olim meminisse juvabit</i> (&ldquo;It will be pleasant
to remember these things hereafter&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The Ola insurrection had continued from October, 1902, to October,
1903, without suspension of civil government. During that period the
jail had been filled far beyond its reasonable capacity most of the
time. It sometimes had contained many hundreds. As to the sanitary
conditions, in passing the jail building one day in company with one of
the provincial officials, he remarked to me, nonchalantly:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s equivalent to a death sentence to put a man in that
jail.&rdquo; I afterwards found out that this was no joke. During most
of my visit to the province I was too busy holding court and separating
the sheep from the goats, to think much of anything else. But toward
the close of the term, after Christmas, after Governor Taft had left
the Islands and gone home to be Secretary of War, an incident happened
that produced a profound impression on me, suggested a new view-point,
and started troubled doubts as to whether the whole Benevolent
Assimilation business was not a mistake born of a union of avarice and
piety in which avarice predominated&mdash;doubts which certain events
of the following year, hereinafter related, converted in conviction
that any decent kind of government of Filipinos by Filipinos would be
better for all concerned than any government we could give them,
hampered as we always will be by the ever-present necessity to argue
that government against the consent of the governed is not altogether
wrong, and that taxation without representation may be a blessing in
disguise. The Yule-tide incident above alluded to was this. Most of the
docket having been disposed of, and there being a lull between
Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb430"
href="#pb430" name="pb430">430</a>]</span>day which afforded time for
matters more or less perfunctory in their nature, the prosecuting
attorney brought in rough drafts of two proposed orders for the court
to sign. One was headed with a list of fifty-seven names, the other
with a list of sixty-three names. Both orders recited that &ldquo;the
foregoing&rdquo; persons had died in the jail&mdash;all but one between
May 20 and Dec. 3. 1903 (roughly six and one-half months) as will
appear from an examination of the dates of death&mdash;and concluded by
directing that the indictments be quashed. The writer was only holding
an extraordinary term of court there in Albay, and was about to leave
the province to take charge of another district to which Governor Taft
had assigned him before leaving the Islands. The newly appointed
regular judge of the district, Judge Trent, now of the Philippine
Supreme Court, was scheduled soon to arrive. Therefore the writer did
not sign the proposed orders but kept them as legal curios. A correct
translation of one of them appears below, followed by the list of names
which headed the other (identical) order:</p>

<p>These lists were printed in an article by the author which appeared
in the <i>North American Review</i> for January 18, 1907, which article
was reprinted by Hon. James L. Slayden, of Texas, in the
<i>Congressional Record</i> for February 12, 1907. There can be little
doubt that President Taft saw the article, and that if it had contained
any inaccuracies they would long since have been noticed. So that in
the Albay jail in 1903 we had a sort of Andersonville prison, or Black
Hole of Calcutta, on a small scale.</p>
<p>If the military authorities had had charge of the Albay insurrection
and of the prisoners in the Albay jail in 1903, it is safe to say that
the great majority of those who died would have lived. But to have
ordered out the troops would have been to abandon the official fiction
that there was peace.</p>
<p>Of Ola&rsquo;s five or six hundred men, Judge Carson and I, assisted
by the chief prosecuting attorney of the government, Hon. James Ross,
turned several hundred loose. Another large batch were disposed of
under a vagrancy law, which allowed us to put them to work on the roads
of the provinces for not exceeding two years, usually six to twelve
months. Most of the remainder, a few score, we tried under the sedition
law, and sent to Bilibid, the central penitentary at Manila, for terms
commensurate with their individual conduct and deeds. The more serious
cases were sent up for longer terms under the brigandage law. We
indulged in no more maudlin sentiment about those precious scamps who
had been degrading Filipino patriotism by occasionally invoking its
name in the course of a long season of preying upon their respectable
fellow-countrymen than Aguinaldo or Juan Cailles would have indulged. I
am quite sure that either Aguinaldo or Juan Cailles would have made
much shorter shrift of the whole bunch <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb435" href="#pb435" name="pb435">435</a>]</span>than Judge Carson and
I did. It was only the men shown to have committed crimes usually
punished capitally in this country that we sentenced to death&mdash;a
dozen or more, all told. Ola was the star witness for the state. He
held back nothing that would aid the prosecuting attorney to convict
the men who had followed him for a year. He was given a sentence of
thirty years (by Judge Carson), as a sort of expression of opinion of
the most Christian attitude possible concerning his real deserts, but
his services as state&rsquo;s evidence entitled him to immunity, and
for that very good and sufficient reason Judge Carson, Prosecuting
Attorney Ross, and myself so recommended to the Governor.</p>
<p>Ola could read and write after a fashion, though he was quite an
ignorant man. But to show what his control must have been over the rank
and file of his men, let one incident suffice. On the boat going up to
Manila from Albay, after the term of court was over, Ola was aboard, en
route for the penitentiary. But, as he was a prospective recipient of
executive clemency, though the guards kept an eye on him, he was
allowed the freedom of the ship. One night on the voyage up, the
weather being extremely warm, I left my stateroom sometime after
midnight, carrying blanket and pillow, and went back to the storm
steering-gear at the stern of the ship, to spend the rest of the night
more comfortably. Waking sometime afterward for some unassignable
cause, I realized that the crown of another head was tangent to the
crown of my own, and occupying part of my pillow. It was Ola, the chief
of the brigands. I raised up, shook the intruder, and said:
&ldquo;Hello, Ola, what are you doing here?&rdquo; He wakened slowly.
He had no idea of any first-class passenger being back there, and had
taken it for granted that I was one of the ship&rsquo;s crew, when he
decided to share my pillow. As <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb436"
href="#pb436" name="pb436">436</a>]</span>soon as he realized who I
was, he sprang to his feet with profound and effusive apologies, and
paced the deck until morning, perhaps thinking over the possible effect
of the incident on my recommendation concerning himself.</p>
<p>After I had recovered the use of all my pillow I went back to sleep
for a spell. About dawn I was wakened by some of the guards chattering.
But I heard Ola, who had apparently been keeping watch over my august
slumbers in the meantime, say in an imperious tone to the guards,
<i>his keepers</i>, &ldquo;Hush, the judge is sleeping.&rdquo; They
looked at the brigand chief, and cowed, obeyed.</p>
<p>Ola was pardoned. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437"

President Roosevelt cabled Kelly, whom he had known in the West many
years before, congratulating him on the results of his cool and
determined fearlessness and presence of mind on that occasion, but
elaboration on the Surigao affair was not part of the insular

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Just before Governor Taft left the Islands in 1903, he
made a speech which made him immensely popular with the Filipinos and
immensely unpopular with the Americans. The key-note of the speech was
&ldquo;The Philippines for the Filipinos.&rdquo; The Filipinos
interpreted it to mean for them that ultimate independence was not so
far in the dim distance of what is to happen after all the living are
dead as to be a purely academic matter. And there was absolutely
nothing in the speech to negative that idea, although he must have
known how the great majority of the Filipinos would interpret the
speech. On the other hand, the Americans in the Islands, popularity
with whom was then and there a negligible factor, interpreted the
speech, not inaccurately, to mean for them: &ldquo;If you white men out
here, not connected with the Government, you Americans, British,
Germans and Spaniards, and the rest of you, do not like the way I am
running this country, why, the boats have not quit running between here
and your respective homes.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10281src"
href="#xd27e10281" name="xd27e10281src">1</a> Then he came back
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb438" href="#pb438" name=
"pb438">438</a>]</span>to the United States and has ever since been
urging American capital to go to the Philippines, all the time opposing
any declaration by the law-making power of the Government which will
let the American who goes out there know &ldquo;where he is at,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, whether we are or are not going to keep the Islands
permanently, and how to formulate his earthly plans accordingly, though
the educated Filipinos are concurrently permitted to clamor against
American &ldquo;exploitation,&rdquo; American rule, and Americans
generally, and to keep alive among the masses of their people what they
call &ldquo;the spirit of liberty,&rdquo; and what the insular
government calls the spirit of &ldquo;irreconcilableness.&rdquo;
Clearly, a policy which makes for race friction and race hatred is
essentially soft-headed, not soft-hearted, and ought not to be
permitted to continue. Yet it has been true for twelve years, as one of
President Taft&rsquo;s admiring friends proudly boasted concerning him
some time since:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">One man virtually holds in his keeping the American
conscience with the regard to the Philippines.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10300src" href="#xd27e10300" name="xd27e10300src">2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true, and it is not as it should be. We should either stop
the clamor, or stop the American capital and energy from going to the
Islands. After an American goes out to the Islands, invests his money
there, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb439" href="#pb439" name=
"pb439">439</a>]</span>and casts his fortunes there, unless he is a
renegade, he sticks to his own people out there. Then the Taft policy
steps in and bullyrags him into what he calls &ldquo;knuckling to the
Filipinos,&rdquo; every time he shows any contumacious dissent from the
Taft decision reversing the verdict of all racial history&mdash;which
has been up to date, that wheresoever white men dwell in any
considerable numbers in the same country with Asiatics or Africans, the
white man will rule. Yet the American in the Philippines, once he is
beguiled into going there, must bow to the Taft policies. He has taken
his family to the Islands, and all his worldly interests are there. Yet
he is living under a despotism, a benevolent despotism, it is true, so
long as the non-office-holding American does not openly oppose the
government&rsquo;s policies, but one which, however benevolent, is, so
far as regards any brooking of opposition from any one outside the
government hierarchy, as absolute as any of the other despotic
governments of Asia. Though the Governor of the Philippines does not
wear as much gilt braid as some of his fellow potentates on the
mainland of Asia, still, in all executive matters he wields a power
quite as immediate and substantial, in its operation on his subjects,
as any of his royal colleagues. It never for a moment occurs either to
the American Government official in the Philippines, or to the American
citizen engaged in private business there who is in entire accord with
the policies of the insular government and on terms of friendship with
the officials, that the government under which he is living is any more
of a despotism than the Government of the United States. The shoe never
pinches the American citizen engaged in private business until he
begins, for one reason or another, to be &ldquo;at outs&rdquo; with the
insular government, and to have &ldquo;opinions&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb440" href="#pb440" name=
"pb440">440</a>]</span>which&mdash;American-like&mdash;he at once wants
to express. If he permits himself to get thoroughly out of accord with
the powers that be, the sooner he gets out of the Islands the better
for him. This is the most notorious single fact in the present
situation. There is no public opinion to help such a person, in any
case where he differs with any specific act or policy of the insular
government. The American colony is comparatively small, say between ten
and twenty thousand all told, outside the army (which consists of ten
or twelve thousand individuals living wholly apart from the rest of the
community). The doctor who is known to have the patronage of high
government officials is sure of professional success, and his wife is
sure to receive the social recognition her husband&rsquo;s position in
the community naturally commands; and this permits her to make
auspicious entrance into the game of playing at precedence with her
next neighbor called &ldquo;society,&rdquo; so dear to the hearts of
many otherwise sensible and estimable women&mdash;to say nothing of
carpet knights, callow youths, cads, and aging gourmands. Also if the
doctor and his lady have adult children, their opportunities to marry
well are multiplied by the sunlight from the seats of the mighty. Thus
the doctor and his wife are a standing lesson to the man &ldquo;with
convictions&rdquo; that yearn for utterance, but who is also blessed
with a discreet helpmate, more concerned in the general welfare and
happiness of all the family than in seeing her husband&rsquo;s name in
the paper. What is true of the doctor is also true of the lawyer known
to be <i>persona grata</i> to the government. Again, the newspaper man
in favor with the government is sure to get his share of the government
advertising, according to a very liberal construction, and that insures
his being able to command reportorial and editorial talent such
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb441" href="#pb441" name=
"pb441">441</a>]</span>as will sell his paper, and the consequent
circulation is sure to get him the advertising patronage of the
mercantile community, thus placing success for him on a solid,
comfortable basis. Also, a contrary course will, slowly, maybe, but
surely, freeze out any rash competitor. Consequently, the American in
the Philippines is deprived of one of his most precious home pleasures,
viz., letting off steam, in some opposition paper, about the real or
imagined shortcomings of the men in charge of the government. For the
reasonable expectancy of life of an opposition paper in Manila is
pathetically brief. The hapless editor on the prosperous paper,
whatever his talents, who happens to become afflicted with
&ldquo;views&rdquo; which he airs in his editorial columns, is soon
upbraided by his friends at his club as &ldquo;getting cranky,&rdquo;
and is told by the orthodox old-timers among them, &ldquo;John,
you&rsquo;ve been out here too long. You better go home.&rdquo; If he
does not change his tone, the receipts of the advertising department of
his paper soon fall off, and his friend, the more tactful proprietor,
who &ldquo;knows how to get along with people,&rdquo; is not long in
agreeing with the rest of his friends that he has &ldquo;been out here
too long.&rdquo; Again the successful merchant has too many interests
at stake in which he needs the cordial friendship of the government to
be able to afford to antagonize it. And so on, through every walk of
life, the influence of the government permeates every nook and corner
of the situation.</p>
<p>The average public man in the United States would not feel
&ldquo;nat&rsquo;ral&rdquo; unless intermittently bedewed with steam
from the exhaust valve of the soul of some &ldquo;outraged
citizen,&rdquo; through the medium of the public press. But in the
Philippines a public man occupying a conspicuous position with the
government may be very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb442" href=
"#pb442" name="pb442">442</a>]</span>generally detested and actually
not know it.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10321src" href="#xd27e10321"
name="xd27e10321src">3</a> The American in the Philippines, with all
his home connections severed, might as well send his family to the
poor-house at once as to come out in a paper with an interview or
speech,&mdash;even supposing any paper would publish it&mdash;which,
copied by the papers back in the United States, would embarrass the
National Administration&rsquo;s Philippine policy in any way. The same
applies to talking too freely for the newspapers when home on a
visit.</p>
<p>I think the foregoing makes sufficiently obvious the inherent
impossibility of the American people ever knowing anything about
current governmental mistakes in the Philippines, of which there must
be some, in time for their judgment to have anything to do with shaping
the course of the government out there for which they are responsible.
And therefore it shows the inherent unfitness of their governmental
machinery to govern the Filipinos so long as they do not change the
home form of government to meet the needs of the colonial situation, by
providing a method of invoking the public judgment on a single issue,
as in the case of monarchical ministries, instead of lumping issues as
we now do. It is certainly a shame that the fate and future of the
Philippines are to-day dependent upon issues as wholly foreign to
anything Philippine as is the price of cheese in Kamchatka or the price
of wool in the United States. Whether the Filipinos are fit for
self-government or not, under our present form of government we are
certainly wholly unfit to govern them. In our government of the
Filipinos, the nature of the case eliminates our most valuable
governmental asset, to wit, that saving grace of public opinion which
stops <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href="#pb443" name=
"pb443">443</a>]</span>public men, none of whom are infallible, before
they can accomplish irreparable mischief, through uncorrected faith in
plans of questionable wisdom and righteousness to which their minds are
made up.</p>
<p>To show how absolute was the executive and legislative power over
8,000,000 of people entrusted by the sole authority of President
McKinley to Governor Taft&mdash;without consulting Congress, though
afterwards the authority so conferred was ratified by Congress and
descended from Governor Taft to his successor&mdash;an incident related
to me in the freedom of social intercourse, and not in the least in
confidence, by my late beloved friend Arthur W. Fergusson, long
Executive Secretary to Governor Taft, will suffice. In 1901 the
Commission had passed a law providing for the constitution of the
Philippine judiciary,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10330src" href=
"#xd27e10330" name="xd27e10330src">4</a> according to which law an
American, in order to be eligible to appointment as a Judge of First
Instance (the ordinary trial court, or <i lang="la">nisi prius</i>
court, of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence) must be more than thirty years
old, and must have practised law in the United States for a period of
five years before appointed. In 1903 President Roosevelt wanted to make
Hon. Beekman Winthrop (then under thirty years of age) now (1912),
Assistant Secretary of the Navy, a Judge of First Instance. Governor
Taft called Fergusson in and said: &ldquo;Fergy, make me out a
commission for Beekman Winthrop as a Judge of First Instance.&rdquo;
Fergusson said: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it, Governor. It&rsquo;s
against the law. He&rsquo;s not old enough.&rdquo; Winthrop was a
graduate of the Harvard Law School. Governor Taft said humorously,
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t eh? I&rsquo;ll show you. Send me a
stenographer.&rdquo; A law was dictated<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e10336src" href="#xd27e10336" name="xd27e10336src">5</a> striking
out thirty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb444" href="#pb444" name=
"pb444">444</a>]</span>years and inserting twenty-five, and adding
after the words &ldquo;must have practised law for a period of five
years&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or be a graduate of a reputable law
school.&rdquo; Fergusson was then called in, and told to go down the
hall, see the other commissioners,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10341src"
href="#xd27e10341" name="xd27e10341src">6</a> and get them together,
which he did, and the law was passed in a few minutes. Then Fergusson
was sent for, and the Governor said, handing him the new
&ldquo;law&rdquo;; &ldquo;Now make out that commission.&rdquo; Even if
Fergusson colored the incident up a bit, in the exercise of his
inimitable artistic capacity to make <i>anything</i> interesting, his
story was certainly substantially correct relatively to the
absoluteness of the authority of the Governor, as will appear by
reference to the two laws cited.</p>
<p>It is only fair to say that Winthrop made a very good judge. There
used to be current in the Philippines a story that Governor Taft had
said, in more or less humorous vein: &ldquo;Gentlemen, I&rsquo;m
somewhat of an expert on judges. What you need in a judge
is&rdquo;&mdash;counting with the index finger of one hand on the
fingers of the other&mdash;&ldquo;firstly, integrity; secondly,
courage; thirdly, common sense; and fourthly, he <i>must</i> know a
<i>little</i> law.&rdquo; Winthrop&rsquo;s integrity, courage, and
common sense were beyond all question. It could hardly have been
otherwise. He came of a long line of sturdy and distinguished men, the
first of whom had come over in the <i>Mayflower</i> days to the
Massachusetts coast. And, he <i>did</i> know a <i>little</i> law. But
the manner of his appointment is none the less illustrative of how much
quicker, Governor Taft could make and publish a law than any of his
fellow despots<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10366src" href="#xd27e10366"
name="xd27e10366src">7</a> over on the mainland of Asia, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb445" href="#pb445" name=
"pb445">445</a>]</span>considering how slow-moving all <i>their</i>
various grand viziers were, compared with Fergy, and his corps of
stenographers.</p>
<p>Having now given, I hope, a more or less sympathetic insight into
what absolute rulers our governors in the Philippines have been, in the
very nature of the case, from the beginning, let us observe the change
of tone of the government, after the reign of the first ended, and the
reign of the second began. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb446" href=

of February 19, 1903, which was received with such profound chagrin by
the American business community in the Islands. There had been much bad
blood between the American colony at and about Iloilo and the native
Americano-phobes. The following is from the Iloilo paper&rsquo;s
account of Governor Taft&rsquo;s speech: &ldquo;The Governor then gave
some advice to foreigners and Americans, remarking that if they found

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Governor Taft left the Philippines on or about
December 23, 1903, to become Secretary of War in President
Roosevelt&rsquo;s Cabinet, and shortly afterward Vice-Governor Luke E.
Wright succeeded to the governorship. After the accession of Governor
Wright, there was no more hammering it into the American business men
having money invested in the Islands that the Filipino was their
&ldquo;little brown brother,&rdquo; for whom no sacrifice, however
sublime, would be more than was expected. Governor Wright was quite
unpopular with the Filipinos and immensely popular with the Americans
and Europeans, because, soon after he came into power, he &ldquo;let
the cat out of the bag,&rdquo; by letting the Filipinos know plainly
that they might just as well shut up talking about independence for the
present, so far as he was advised and believed; in other words, that
Governor Taft&rsquo;s &ldquo;Philippines for the Filipinos&rdquo; need
not cause any specially billowy sighs of joy just yet, because it had
no reference to any Filipinos now able to sigh, but only to unborn
Filipinos who might sigh in some remote future generation; and that the
slogan which had caused them all to want <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb447" href="#pb447" name="pb447">447</a>]</span>to sob simultaneously
for joy on the broad chest of Governor Taft was merely a case of an
amiable unwillingness to tell them an unpleasant truth, viz., that in
his opinion they were wholly unfit for self-government&mdash;all of
which, in effect, meant that Governor Taft had been merely
&ldquo;Keeping the word of promise to the ear and breaking it to the
hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wright plain talk made the Filipinos one and all feel:
&ldquo;Alackaday! Our true friend has departed.&rdquo; But as Secretary
of War Taft, after four years more of trying to please both sides, at
home, at last frankly told the Filipinos when he went out to attend the
opening of the first Philippine legislature, in 1907, practically just
what Governor Wright had begun to tell them from the moment his
predecessor had exchanged the parting tear with them on the water-front
at Manila in 1903, the net result of the Wright policy of
uncompromising honesty on the <i>present</i> political situation, may
easily be guessed.</p>
<p>Governor Wright&rsquo;s method of repudiating the Taft straddle took
for <i>its</i> key-note, in lieu of &ldquo;The Philippines for the
Filipinos,&rdquo; the slogan &ldquo;An Equal Chance for All.&rdquo;
What Governor Wright meant was merely that there would be no more
browbeating of Americans to make them love their little brown brother
as much as Governor Taft was supposed to love him, but that everybody
would be treated absolutely alike and nobody coddled. However, the
Filipinos of course knew that they could not compete with American
wealth and energy, and so did the Americans in the islands. So what the
Wright slogan, unquestionably fair as was its intent, inexorably meant
to everybody concerned except the dignified, straightforward and candid
propounder of it, was, in effect, the British &ldquo;White Man&rsquo;s
Burden&rdquo; or Trust-for-Civilization theory, a theory whereunder the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb448" href="#pb448" name=
"pb448">448</a>]</span>white man who wants some one else&rsquo;s land
goes and takes it on the idea that he can put it to better use than the
owner. Thus early did the original &ldquo;jollying&rdquo; Mr. Taft had
given them become transparent to his little brown brother. Thus early
did it become clear to the Filipinos that behind the mask of executive
protestations that they shall some day have independence when fit for
it, lurks a set determination industriously to earn for an
indeterminate number of generations yet to come</p>

<p class="first">This book has been written, up to this point, in vain,
if the preceding chapters have not made clear how much political
expediency, looking to the welfare of a party in power naturally
seeking to continue in power, necessarily dominates Philippine affairs
under American rule. We have observed under the microscope of history,
made available by the official documents now accessible, the long
battle between the political expediency germ and the independence bug
which began in General Anderson&rsquo;s dealings with Aguinaldo and
continued through General Merritt&rsquo;s and General Otis&rsquo;s
<i>r&eacute;gimes</i>. We have seen General MacArthur&rsquo;s attempt
at a wise surgical operation to excise the independence bug from the
Philippine body politic&mdash;so that the expediency germ might die a
natural death from having nothing to feed on. We have seen that
operation interfered with by the Taft Commission during the
presidential campaign of 1900, because the men in control of the
republic could not ignore considerations of political expediency; and
we saw the consequent premature setting up of the civil government in
1901, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb449" href="#pb449" name=
"pb449">449</a>]</span>with all its dire consequences in the then as
yet unconquered parts of the archipelago, southern Luzon, and some of
the Visayan Islands. We have observed the effective though heroic local
treatment administered to the Philippine body politic by General Bell
in Batangas in 1901&ndash;2, with a view of killing off the
independence bug there. We have seen the fierce struggle between some
of the bug&rsquo;s belated spawn and the expediency germ&rsquo;s now
more emboldened forces in Albay in the off year, 1903. We are now to
take our fifth year&rsquo;s course in the colonial department of
politico-entomological research, the presidential year 1904.</p>
<p>It was the way the Samar insurrection of 1904&ndash;5-6 was handled
which finally convinced me that the Filipinos would not kill any more
of each other in a hundred years than we have killed, or permitted to
be killed, of them, in the fell process of Benevolent Assimilation.</p>
<p>American imperialism is not honest, like the British variety.
American imperialism knows that Avarice was its father, and Piety its
mother, and that it takes after its father more than it does after its
mother. British imperialism frankly aims mostly to make <i>the
survivors</i> of its policies happy, not the people it immediately
operates on. American imperialism pretends to be ministering to the
happiness of the living, and, though it realizes that it is not a
success in that line, it resents identification with its British
cousin, by sanctimonious reference to the alleged net good it is doing.
Yet in its moments of frankness it says, with an air of infinite
patience under base ingratitude, &ldquo;Well, they will be happy in
some other generation,&rdquo; and that therefore the number of people
we <i>have</i> had or <i>may</i> have, to kill, or permit to be killed,
in the process of Benevolent Assimilation, is wholly negligible. This
is simply the old, old argument that the end justifies <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb450" href="#pb450" name="pb450">450</a>]</span>the
means, the argument that has wrought more misery in the world than any
other since time began.</p>
<p>When Judge Taft, General Wright, and their colleagues of the Taft
Commission, came out to the Philippines in 1900, they came full of the
McKinley convictions about a people whom neither they or Mr. McKinley
had ever seen, bound hand and foot by political necessity to square the
freeing of Cuba with the subjugation of the Philippines. A perfectly
natural evolution of this attitude resulted in the position they at
once took on arriving in the Islands, viz., that to do for the
Filipinos what we have done for the Cubans would mean a bloody welter
of anarchy and chaos. And the presidential contest of 1900 was fought
and won largely on that issue. After 1900, for all the gentlemen above
referred to, the proposition was always <i lang="la">res
adjudicata</i>. All protests by Filipinos to the contrary caused only
resentment, and welded the authorities more and more hermetically to
the correctness of the original proposition. Loyalty to the original
ill-considered decision became impregnated, in their case, with a
fervor not entirely unlike religious fanaticism, and belief in it
became a matter of principle, justifying all they had done, and guiding
all they might thereafter do. So that when General Wright &ldquo;came
to the throne&rdquo; in our colonial empire, as Governor, and legatee
of the McKinley-Taft Benevolent Assimilation policies, his attitude in
all he did was thoroughly honest, and also thoroughly British. He
honestly believed in the &ldquo;bloody welter of anarchy and
chaos&rdquo; proposition, and was prepared, in any emergency that might
arise, to follow his convictions in that regard whithersoever they
might lead, without variableness or shadow of turning. Take him all in
all, Governor Wright was about the best man occupying exalted
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb451" href="#pb451" name=
"pb451">451</a>]</span>station I ever knew personally, President Taft
himself not excepted; although I still adhere to Colonel
Roosevelt&rsquo;s opinion of 1901 concerning Mr. Taft, quoted in the
chapter preceding this, from the <i>Outlook</i> of September 21, 1901,
notwithstanding that in the contest for the Republican nomination for
the presidency in 1912, the Colonel &ldquo;recalled&rdquo; that
opinion. Seriously, a man may &ldquo;combine the qualities which would
make a first class President of the United States with the qualities
which would make a first class Chief Justice of the United
States&rdquo; and still cut a sorry figure trying to fit a square peg
into a round hole, or a scheme of government, the breath of whose life
is public opinion, into the running of a remote colonial government,
the breath of whose life is exemption from being interfered with by
public opinion.</p>
<p>After the Albay insurrection of 1903 had been cleaned up, I took
charge of the Twelfth Judicial District, having been appointed thereto
by Governor Taft just before he left the islands to become Secretary of
War. In those trying pioneer days they always seemed to give me the
insurrections to sift out, but it was purely fortuitous. Whenever you
ceased to be busy, prompt arrangements were made for you to get busy
again. Judge Ide, the Minister of Justice, wasted no government

<p>The Twelfth District consisted of the two island provinces of Samar
and Leyte, two of the six Visayan Islands heretofore noticed as the
only ones worth considering in a general view of the archipelago such
as the student of world politics wants or needs. Leyte had a population
of 388,922,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10453src" href="#xd27e10453"
name="xd27e10453src">1</a> and an area of 3008 square miles.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e10458src" href="#xd27e10458" name=
"xd27e10458src">2</a> Samar&rsquo;s population was 266,237, and its
area, 5276 square miles, makes it the third largest island of the
Philippine Archipelago. So that as Judge <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb452" href="#pb452" name="pb452">452</a>]</span>of the Twelfth
District, consisting of two provinces, the Governor of each of which
was <i>ex-officio</i> sheriff of the court for his province, I was, in
a sense, a sort of shepherd of a political flock of some 650,000
people, whom I always thought of as a whole as &ldquo;my&rdquo;
people.</p>
<p>Samar and Leyte are separated, where nearest together, by a most
picturesque winding strait bordered with densely wooded hills. San
Juanico Strait is much narrower than the inland sea of Japan at its
narrowest point, and almost as beautiful. In fact, at its narrowest
point it seems little more than a stone&rsquo;s throw in width. It is
as pretty as the prettiest part of the Golden Horn. Leyte had been put
under the Civil Government in 1901, and this premature interference
with the military authorities in the midst of their efforts to pacify
the island had had the usual result of postponing pacification, by
filling local politicians, wholly unable to comprehend a government
which <i>entreated</i> or <i>reasoned</i> with people to do things,
with the notion that we were resorting to diplomacy in lieu of force
because of fear of them. Leyte and Samar were strategically one for the
insurgents, just as the provinces of the Lake district of Luzon,
described in an earlier chapter, were, because they could flee by night
from one province to another in small boats without detection, when
hard pressed by the <i>Americano</i>. The main insurgent general in
Samar, Lucban, had surrendered to General Grant in 1902, but the
cheaper fellows stayed out much longer, preying upon those who
preferred daily toil to cattle-stealing and throat-cutting as a means
of livelihood, and continuing the political unrest intermittently in
gradually diminishing degree, through 1903. By the spring of 1904,
however, there still remained in Samar riffraff enough, the
<i>jetsam</i> and <i>flotsam</i> of the insurrection&mdash;professional
outlaws&mdash;to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb453" href="#pb453"
name="pb453">453</a>]</span>get up some trouble, so that, as brigand
chiefs, they might resume the r&ocirc;les of Robin Hood, Jesse James,
<i>et al.</i> During the first half of that year the opportunity these
worthies had been waiting for, while resting on their oars, developed.
The crop of municipal officials resulting from the original McKinley
plan of beginning the work of reconstruction <i>during</i>, instead of
<i>after</i>, the war, and among the potential village Hampdens,
instead of among the Cromwells, had resulted in some very rascally
municipal officials who oppressed the poor, getting the hemp of the
small farmer, when they would bring it to town, at their own
prices&mdash;hemp being to Samar what cotton is to the South. From the
lowland and upland farmers the ever-widening discontent spread to the
hills, where dwelt a type of people constituting only a small fraction
of the total population of the Islands&mdash;&ldquo;half savage and
half child&rdquo;&mdash;but loving their hills, and wholly indisposed,
of their own initiative, to start trouble, unless manipulated.
Obviously, then, &ldquo;the public mind&rdquo; of Samar&mdash;those who
know Samar will smile with me at the phrase, but it will do, for lack
of a better&mdash;was likely soon to be in a generally inflammable
condition. By July, 1904, the Robin Hoods, Jesse Jameses, <i>et
al.</i>, touched the match to the material and a political
conflagration started, apparently as unguided&mdash;save by the winds
of impulse&mdash;and certainly as persistent, as a forest fire. Every
native of the Philippine Islands, whether he be of the 7,000,000
Christians or of the 500,000 non-Christian tribes, is born with a
highly developed social instinct either to command or to obey. The
latter tendency is quite as common in the Philippines as the former is
in the United States. Hence the Samar disturbances of 1904&ndash;5-6,
though made up at the outset of raids and depredations by various
roving bands of outlaws <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb454" href=
"#pb454" name="pb454">454</a>]</span>yielding allegiance only to their
immediate chief, soon took on a very formidable military and political
aspect.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10503src" href="#xd27e10503" name=
"xd27e10503src">3</a> The roving bands would ask the peaceably inclined
people our flag was supposed to be protecting, &ldquo;Are you for us or
for the Americans?&rdquo; promptly chopping their heads off if they
showed any lack of zeal in denouncing American municipal institutions
and things American in general. Pursuant to Mr. McKinley&rsquo;s
original scheme&mdash;concocted for a people he had never seen, under
pressure of political necessity&mdash;to rig up in short order a
government &ldquo;essentially popular in form,&rdquo; a lot of most
pitiable municipal governments had been let loose on the people, a part
of our series of kindergarten lessons. The plan was as wise as it will
be for the Japanese&mdash;some one please hold Captain Hobson while I
finish the analogy&mdash;when they conquer the United States, to go to
the Bowery and the Ghetto for mayors of all our cities. Thus by our
pluperfect benevolence, we had contrived in Samar by 1904 to rouse the
highland folk, or hill people, whom the Spaniards had always let alone,
against the pacific agricultural lowland people and the dwellers in the
coast villages. The latter, or such of them as did not join the hill
folk for protection, we permitted to be mercilessly butchered by
wholesale, from August to November, 1904, as hereinafter more fully set
forth, because ordering out the army to protect them might have been
construed at home to mean disturbances <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb455" href="#pb455" name="pb455">455</a>]</span>more serious and
widespread than actually existed, and might therefore affect the
presidential election in the United States by renewing the notion that
the Administration had never been frank with the American people
concerning conditions in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The annual report of the Philippine Commission for 1904 is dated
November 1st, which was just a week before the presidential election
day of that year. Their annual report for 1905 is dated November 1,
1905. In their report for 1904, the Commission deal with the general
state of public order in the same roseate manner which, as we have
seen, had made its first appearance during the political exigencies of
1900 in the language about &ldquo;the great majority of the
people&rdquo; being &ldquo;entirely willing&rdquo; to benevolent alien
domination in lieu of independence. When Rip Van Winkle was trying to
quit drinking, he used to say after each drink: &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll
just let that pass.&rdquo; In their report for 1904, the Commission
swallow the conditions in Samar with equal nonchalance. After stating
that some (impliedly negligible) disturbances had occurred in Samar
&ldquo;two months since,&rdquo; they add that &ldquo;the constabulary
of the province took the field&rdquo; against the bands of Pulajans, or
outlaws, and that &ldquo;as a result, they were soon broken up, and are
being pursued and killed or captured&rdquo; (p. 3). In their report
dated November 1, 1905, by way of preface to an account of the
extensive military operations inaugurated in Samar shortly after the
presidential election of 1904, which operations had not only been in
progress for nearly a year on the date of the 1905 report, but
continued for more than a year thereafter, the Commission explain their
1904 nonchalance about Samar thus: &ldquo;It was then believed that the
constabulary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb456" href="#pb456" name=
"pb456">456</a>]</span>forces had succeeded in checking the further
progress of the outbreak&rdquo; (p. 47).</p>
<p>Let us examine the facts on which they based this statement, since
it meant that they believed that a duly reported epidemic of massacres
of peaceably inclined people, over whom the American flag was floating
as a symbol of protection to life and property, had stood effectually
checked by November 1, 1904, the date of their report. And first, of
the massacres themselves, their nature and extent.</p>
<p>The Samar massacres of 1904 began with what we all called down there
&ldquo;the outbreak of July 10th.&rdquo; In August, 1904, I went to
Samar to handle the cases arising out of the disturbances there,
assisted by the (native) Governor of the province, who, under the law
already alluded to, was <i>ex-officio</i> sheriff of the court, and an
army of deputy sheriffs, as it were, the constabulary, numbering
several hundred. The outbreak of July 10th was always known afterwards
as &ldquo;the Tauiran affair.&rdquo; This Tauiran affair was a raid by
an outlaw band on the <i>barrio</i> of Tauiran, one of the hamlets of
the municipal jurisdiction of the township called Gandara, in the
valley of the Gandara River, in north central Samar, wherein one
hundred houses, the whole settlement, were burned, and twenty-one
people killed. The term of court lasted from early in August until
early in November. The day after the Tauiran affair, over on the other
fork of the Gandara River, occurred what was called &ldquo;the
Cantaguic affair.&rdquo; Cantaguic was a hamlet or <i>barrio</i> about
the size of Tauiran. The brigands killed the lieutenant of police of
Cantaguic and some others, but they did not kill everybody in the
place. Instead, after killing a few people, they went to the
<i>tribunal</i> (town hall), seized the local <i>teniente</i>, or
municipal representative of American <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb457" href="#pb457" name="pb457">457</a>]</span>authority, tied the
American flag they found at the <i>tribunal</i> about the head of the
<i>teniente</i>, turban fashion, poured kerosene oil on it, and took
the <i>teniente</i> down stairs and out into the public square, where
they lighted and burned the flag on his head, the chief of the band,
one Juliano Caducoy by name, remarking to the onlookers that the act
was intended as a lesson to those serving that flag. They then cut off
the lips of the <i>teniente</i> so he could not eat (he of course died
a little later), burned the <i>barrio</i> and carried off fifty of the
inhabitants. Caducoy was captured some time afterward, and I sentenced
him to be hanged. There was practically no dispute about the facts.
After the Cantaguic affair, during the term of court mentioned, the
provincial doctor, Dr. Cullen, an American who had been a captain
doctor of volunteers, had occasion to run up to Manila. The doctor was
a most accomplished gentleman, but he had a fondness for the grewsome
in description equal to Edgar Allan Poe himself. After he came back he
told me about having told the Governor-General of the Cantaguic affair,
and repeated with an evident pleased consciousness of his ability to
make his hearer&rsquo;s blood curdle, how the Governor had said to him
slowly, &ldquo;Doctor, that&mdash;is&mdash;<i>aw</i>ful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blood seemed to whet the appetite for slaughter. The records of the
August&ndash;November, 1904 term of the court of first instance of
Samar show all the various <i>barrios</i> of the Gandara Valley in
flames on successive days, after the affairs of July 10th and 11th. I
do not speak from memory, but from documents contained in a large
bundle of papers kept ever since, in memory of that incarnadined epoch.
You find one <i>barrio</i> burned one day and another another day,
until all the people of the Gandara Valley were made homeless. One of
the constabulary officers, Lieutenant Bowers, a very <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb458" href="#pb458" name=
"pb458">458</a>]</span>gallant fellow, testified before me that from
July 10th to the date of his testimony, which was on or about September
28th, some 50,000 people had been made homeless in Samar by the
operations of the outlaws. I deem Lieutenant Bowers&rsquo;s estimate
quite reasonable. His figures include only one-fifth of the population
of an island which was in the throes of an all-pervading brigand
uprising. The conservative nature of Lieutenant Bowers&rsquo;s estimate
concerning the mischief that had already been wrought by the end of
September, 1904, and was then gathering destructive potentiality like a
forest or prairie fire, may be inferred from the contents of a
memorandum appearing below, furnished me by a Spanish officer of the
constabulary, a Lieutenant Calderon, who had been an officer of the
Rural Guard in the Spanish days. It contains a list of fifty-three
towns, villages, and hamlets (a <i>barrio</i> may be quite a village,
sometimes even quite a town, though usually it is a hamlet) burned up
to the date the memorandum was furnished me.</p>
<p>In order to a clear understanding of these Samar massacres and
town-burnings of 1904, as well as for general geographical purposes, a
few preliminary words of explanation will be appropriate just here. A
province in the Philippines has heretofore been likened to a county
with us. But in the largest provinces, the <i>subdivisions</i> of
provinces called <i>municipalities</i> are more like counties; and each
municipality is in turn subdivided into sections called <i>barrios</i>.
A municipality (Spanish, <i>pueblo</i>) in the Philippines is not
primarily a city or town, as we understand it, <i>i.e.</i>, a more or
less continuous settlement of houses and lots more or less adjacent,
but a specific area of territory, a township, as it were. This area or
territory may be 5 &times; 10 square miles, or 10 &times; 20, or more,
or less. For example, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb459" href=
"#pb459" name="pb459">459</a>]</span>Samar&rsquo;s area is 5276 square
miles. Yet it contained in 1904, and probably still contains, only
twenty-five townships or municipalities all told, each municipality
being subdivided in turn into <i>barrios</i>. Municipalities in the
Philippines vary in size as much as counties do with us, and their
total area accounts for and represents the total area of the province,
just as the total area of the counties of a State represents with us
the total area of the State. The seat of government of the municipality
<i>always</i> bears the same name as the municipality itself, just as
the county seat of a county usually, or frequently, bears the same name
as the county, with us. Take for instance, the name of the first
municipality or township in the list which appears below, Gandara. The
municipality of Gandara might be described by analogy as the
&ldquo;county&rdquo; of Gandara, the list of <i>barrios</i> burned as a
list of towns and villages of the &ldquo;county&rdquo; of Gandara.</p>
<p>The municipality of Gandara included a watershed in north central
Samar from which the Gandara River flowed in a southwesterly direction
to the sea. Within this watershed, parallel 12&frac12; north of the
equator intersects the 125th meridian of longitude east of Greenwich.
Northern Samar is a very rich hemp country, Catarman hemp being usually
quoted higher than any hemp listed on the London market. If you stand
at the highest point of the Gandara watershed you can see four streams
flowing off north, northwest, northeast, and southwest to the sea.
There are some half dozen streams having their source there. Brigands
making their headquarters there could always, when hard pressed, get
away in canoes toward the sea in almost any direction they wished. The
following is Lieutenant Calderon&rsquo;s list: <span class=

<p>The above list of villages burned in the township of Catbalogan
shows how bold the Pulajans had then grown. By that time they were
committing depredations, robbery, murder, and town-burning, in all the
various villages within the municipal jurisdiction of the township of
Catbalogan, coming often within a few miles of the town proper of
Catbalogan itself, the seat of the provincial government. In the attack
on Silanga, which occurred August 9th, a number of people were killed.
Silanga was but little more than an hour&rsquo;s walk from the
court-house at Catbalogan. The Governor at once wired Manila as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first dateline"><span class="sc">Catbalogan, Samar</span>,

<p class="salute"><span class="sc">Executive Secretary</span>,

<p>The peaceably inclined people of the <i>barrios</i> near here are
collecting here in large numbers, terrorized by Pulajans who are boldly
roaming the country, burning <i>barrios</i> within seven or eight miles
from Catbalogan. They kill men, women, and children without
distinction. These Pulajans have fled from Gandara where they are being
actively pursued by constabulary. All forces that could be spared have
gone out. We have about thirty available fighting men here. <i>Pulajans
liable at any time to enter Catbalogan.</i> We are in danger of some
occurrence quite as serious as the Surigao affair.<a class="noteref"

in Catbalogan. I suspect certain of the municipal authorities here. I
estimate number of Pulajans now operating at about five hundred.</p>
<p class="signed">(<i>Signed</i>) <span class="sc">Feito</span>,
Governor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On September 2d, the Provincial Governor of Samar sent to Manila the
following telegram:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first dateline"><span class="sc">Catbalogan</span>, Sept. 2,
1904.</p>
<p class="salute"><span class="sc">Carpenter</span>, Actg. Ex. Secy.,

presence guarantee stability.</p>

<p>Of course Governor Feito did not call for the regular army of the
United States. His job, poor devil, was to demonstrate as best he could
that the military were not needed. He would at once have been suspected
of trying to scuttle the ship of &ldquo;benign civil government&rdquo;
if he had admitted that the regular army was needed. But to return to

<p>A sample of the distressing communications I was getting as these
massacres progressed is the notification of the Motiong affair of
September 1st set forth below, which I give as a type of the methodical
stoicism of those bloody times. Motiong was seven miles down the coast
road from Catbalogan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">In the district of Motiong, municipality of Wright,
province of Samar, Philippine Islands, September 1, 1904.</p>
<p>In the presence of the undersigned Peregrin Albano, member of the
village council, there being also present the president of the
Municipal Board of Health, Mr. Tomas San Pablo, and the principal men
of the place, there has this day occurred the burial of the corpses,
victims of the Pulajans, in the cemetery of this place, to wit: The
officer of volunteers, Rafael Rosales, and the following <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb464" href="#pb464" name=
"pb464">464</a>]</span>volunteers, viz., Gualberto Gabane, Juan Pacle,
Dionisio Daisno, Pedro Damtanan, Carmelo Lagbo; also the two women,
Eustaquia Sapiten and Apolinaria N., also one unknown Pulajan. This in
fulfilment of the official letter of instructions No. 136, from the
office of the presidente of the town of Wright dated to-day. Said
burial ceremonies were conducted by the Reverend Father Marcos Gomez,
and were attended by the whole volunteer force of this place because of
the death of their officer Rosales.</p>

<p>Fancy having documents like the foregoing handed you with
ever-increasing regularity as you sauntered, morning after morning,
from your bath to your coffee and rolls, preparatory to the daily
sifting of incidents such as that which included the burning of the
American flag on the head of the municipal representative of American
authority already mentioned, and other like acts of poor misguided
peasants stirred up by trifling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb465"
href="#pb465" name="pb465">465</a>]</span>scamps representing the dregs
of insurrection. Motiong was not only within seven miles of the
court-house at Catbalogan, but it was so near to Camp Bumpus, over in
Leyte, where the 18th Infantry lay, that an order to them to move in
the morning would have made life and property in all that
brigand-harried region safe that night and continuously thereafter.</p>
<p>General Wm. H. Carter, Major-General U. S. A., well known to the
American public as the able officer who, in 1911, commanded the United
States forces mobilized on the Mexican border during the Mexican
revolution of that year, that ousted President Diaz and seated
President Madero, was in command at the time&mdash;the fall of
1904&mdash;of the military district of the Philippines which included
Samar and Leyte. A word of request to him would have made life
definitely safe in all the coast towns and their vicinity within two or
three days after receipt of such a request.</p>
<p>Besides Gandara, Catbalogan, Calbayog, and Wright, Lieutenant
Calderon&rsquo;s list included the trio of ill-fated municipalities set
forth below, concluding with the illustrious name of Taft:</p>

<p>Catubig was toward the north end of Samar. On the day of the burning
and sacking of the <i>poblacion</i> of Catubig, September 5th, which
was done by a force of several hundred Pulajans, the scouts and
constabulary, so it was afterward reported, killed a hundred of the
Catubig Pulajans in an engagement. If this report were correct, as is
likely, it was the biggest single killing of natives since the early
days of the insurrection.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e10988src" href=

least check the Pulajan insurrection, which simply swerved its fury
from the Catubig region toward the coast (the Pacific coast),
descending upon the towns, villages, and hamlets of the townships of
Borongan and Taft, thus:</p>

<p>Of the twenty-five pueblos or townships of Samar, the Calderon list
only pretended to throw light on events in nine of them, those being
the only ones from which definite news had then reached headquarters.
But as a reign of terror prevailed all over Samar at the time, the rest
may be imagined, though it can never be ascertained. Of these nine, the
last two were:</p>
<p>MUNICIPALITY OF LLORENTE</p>

<p>Now it feels just as uncomfortable to be boloed in Pagbabalancayan
as it would in a place with a more pronounceable name, and the same is
true of the comparatively mellifluous Jipapad. True, some of these
places were mere hamlets of twenty to forty houses, but you may be sure
there were five or six people, on an average, to each house. On the
other hand, glance back again at the list of towns of the township of
Taft that were sacked and burned, and consider that San Julian was
about the size of the provincial capital, Catbalogan, and that
Catbalogan, the town proper, contained a population of four thousand,
though looked at from the amphitheatre of hills which surround it,
Catbalogan does not look like such a very large group of houses.
Filipino houses are usually full of people. It is easier to live that
way than to build more houses.</p>
<p>After the Pulajan descent on Llorente, the people of Llorente all
went off to the hills <i>to the Pulajans</i> for safety. They were not
allowed to have firearms. This was forbidden by law, except on
condition of making formal application for permission, getting it
finally approved, and giving a bond, conditions which, in practical
operation, made the prohibition all but absolute. The law was general
for the whole archipelago. The theory of the law was that the
inhabitants were under &ldquo;the peace and protection of a benign
civil government.&rdquo; The real reason of the law was that if the
people were allowed to bear arms it was very uncertain which side they
would use them on, our side or the other. But, by 1904, the lowland and
coast people of Samar would have been glad enough to have stuck to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb468" href="#pb468" name=
"pb468">468</a>]</span>us and gone out after the mountain robber bands
had we armed them. Left unprotected, a feeling seemed to spread in many
places that about the only thing to do to be safe was to depart from
under the &ldquo;protection&rdquo; of the American flag and take to the
hills and join, or seem to join, the uprising.</p>
<p>Toward the last of September, the provincial treasurer of Samar, an
American, a Mr. Whittier, visited the east coast of Samar, including
Taft. On October 5th, he stated before me as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">All the presidentes that I have talked with, and this
man Hill,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11133src" href="#xd27e11133" name=
"xd27e11133src">10</a> said that they wanted some protection for their
towns. Except at Borongan there are no guns in the hands of the
municipal police.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11136src" href=
"#xd27e11136" name="xd27e11136src">11</a> This band near Taft was said
to have nineteen guns, and they felt they could not <i>defend their
towns with spears</i> against these guns. There were reported to be
between 200 and 600 in operation on the coast at that time, and they
felt that they could not defend their towns with the means at hand. I
found at Taft that they had taken all the records of the municipality,
and the money, and taken it over to an island away from the main coast,
in order to protect their money and their records, and I understand the
same thing was done at Llorente. At Oras they had practically decided
to take the same step if it became necessary. All of the commercial
houses on the east coast and a large number of people congregated at
Borongan, which was safe on account of the protection of the
constabulary; and the constabulary there were doing very good work,
<i>doing everything they could with their small force</i>, and they
(the presidentes) felt that if they had guns in the hands of the
municipal police or if they had the constabulary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb469" href="#pb469" name="pb469">469</a>]</span>to
guard their towns, they could go out after these people themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The importance of all this testimony, relatively to its forever
sickening any one acquainted with it with colonization by a republic,
is that a transcript of Mr. Whittier&rsquo;s statement of October 5th
was placed in the hands of the Governor-General a few days later by Mr.
Harvey, the Assistant Attorney-General, and yet this situation
continued until shortly after the presidential election. Several years
afterwards, in the <i>North American Review</i>, Judge Ide, who was
Vice-Governor in 1904, after admitting that he was in constant
consultation with the Governor-General all through that period (by way
of showing his opportunities for knowing whereof he spoke), denied that
the failure to order out the military to protect the people from
massacre had any relation whatever to the presidential election then
going on in the United States.</p>
<p>Mr. Whittier also stated before me that the total population of the
municipality of Taft was 18,000, and that twenty-five men armed with
guns in each of the four principal villages thereof that were burned
would have prevented the destruction of those villages. So we did not
protect the people, and we would not let them protect themselves. I do
not select the pueblo of Taft on account of its distinguished name.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in a name?&rdquo; The fate of Taft and its
inhabitants was simply typical of the fate which descended upon scores
of other places in &ldquo;dark and bloody&rdquo; Samar between the
outbreak of July 10, 1904, and the presidential election of November
8th, of that year, and between those two dates the shadow of such a
fate was over all the towns of the island on which it did not in fact
descend. Mr. Whittier stated to me informally that at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb470" href="#pb470" name="pb470">470</a>]</span>the
time he was speaking of in the above formal statement, there were
pending and had been pending for a long time (he seemed to think they
must have been pigeon-holed) applications for permission to bear arms
from fifteen different pueblos. After Mr. Whittier had finished his
statement the Presidente of Taft made a like statement on the same day,
October 5th. My retained copy shows that this official bore the
ponderous name of Angel Custodio Crisologo. He declared a willingness
to lead his people against the Pulajans if given guns, though the
fervent soul <i>did</i> qualify this martial remark by adding,
&ldquo;If I am well enough,&rdquo; explaining that the presidential
body was subject to rheumatism. Mr. Crisologo stated among other things
that there had been eight hundred houses burned in the jurisdiction of
Taft before he left the east coast for Catbalogan&mdash;about a week
before. Like Mr. Whittier&rsquo;s, a copy of Mr. Crisologo&rsquo;s
statement was delivered a few days later to the Governor-General in
person by the Assistant Attorney-General, Mr. Harvey, who had been
present when it was made and taken down.</p>
<p>This Mr. Harvey need not be, to the western hemisphere reader, a
mere nebulous antipodal entity, as the Hon. Angel Custodio Crisologo
might. He is a very live American, a very high-toned gentleman, and an
excellent lawyer, and was at last accounts still with the insular
government of the Philippine Islands, though in a higher capacity
(Solicitor General) than he was at the date of the events herein
narrated. There was very little congenial society in Catbalogan when
Mr. Harvey came there to help dispose of the criminal docket, and his
advent was to me a very welcome oasis in a desert of &ldquo;the
solitude of my own originality&rdquo;&mdash;or lack of originality. On
September 19th I had wired <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb471" href=
"#pb471" name="pb471">471</a>]</span>Vice-Governor Ide that there were
172 prisoners in the jail awaiting trial and &ldquo;many more
coming.&rdquo; Of course no justice of the peace would be trusted to
pass on whether an alleged outlaw should or should not be held for
trial. If he were secretly in sympathy with the discomfiture American
authority in Samar was having, he might let the man go, no matter what
the proof. Also he might seek to clear himself of all suspicion in each
case by committing men against whom there was no proof, thus
unnecessarily crowding an already fast filling provincial jail of
limited dimensions, wherein beriberi<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11167src" href="#xd27e11167" name="xd27e11167src">12</a> was
already making its dread appearance.</p>
<p>So the writ of habeas corpus remained unsuspended, thus making it
possible to so state in later official certificates covering that
period. But habeas corpus cut no more figure in the situation than it
did at the battle of Gettysburg, or at the crossing of the Red Sea by
the chosen people, or at the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i>. The
constabulary would worry along with such force as they had in the
island of Samar, only a few hundred, certainly nearer five hundred than
one thousand. And, whenever they had a battle with the outlaws, if they
themselves were not annihilated, which happened more than once, they
would bring back prisoners in droves and put them in the jail, and I
was expected to sift out how much proof they had, or claimed to have,
of overt acts by persons not actually captured in action. Of course a
race then began, a race against death, to see whether death or I would
get to John Doe or Richard Roe first. And though I held court every day
except Sunday from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb472" href="#pb472"
name="pb472">472</a>]</span>August to November 8th, sometimes getting
in sixteen hours per day by supplementing a day&rsquo;s work with a
night session, death would often beat me to some one man on the jail
list whom I happened to have picked out to get to the next day. Men so
picked out were men as to whom something I might have heard held out
the hope of being able to dispose of their cases quickly by letting
them loose,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11177src" href="#xd27e11177"
name="xd27e11177src">13</a> thus getting that much farther from the
danger limit of crowding in the jail. Some of these would be specially
picked out because reported sick. I kept track of the sick by visiting
them myself when practicable, and talking to them. Of course many of
them were brigands&mdash;Pulajans&mdash;but some of them were the
saddest looking, most abject little brigands that anybody ever saw. Of
course you might catch some nasty disease from them, but nobody,
somehow, ever seemed to have any apprehension on that score in the
Philippines. This does not argue bravery at all. It is merely the
listless stoicism that lurks in the climate. I recollect going to walk
one afternoon, after adjourning court at 5 o&rsquo;clock, saying to the
prosecuting attorney before adjourning, &ldquo;We will take up the case
of Capence Coral in the morning; there does not seem, from what I can
understand, to be enough proof to convict him of anything.&rdquo; Of
course when you were dealing with hundreds of people, you did not have
any nerve-racking hysterics about any one man. Leaving the court-house
I passed by the hospital, where Capence had been transferred, pending
the arrival of witnesses against him and the rest of the crowd captured
with him. I asked the hospital steward <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb473" href="#pb473" name="pb473">473</a>]</span>how Capence was. The
answer was he had died at 4:45&mdash;some twenty minutes before. Death
had beat me to Capence. When I meet Capence he will know I did the best
I could. I was under a great strain, a sort of writ of habeas corpus
incarnate, the only thing remotely suggesting relief from
unwarranted<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11182src" href="#xd27e11182"
name="xd27e11182src">14</a> detention on the whole horizon of the
situation. I was trying to do the best I could by the Constitution, in
so far as the spirit of it had reached the Philippines. I broke down
totally under the strain about November 8th, came home in the spring of
the following year and remained an invalid for several years
thereafter; and as a noted corporation lawyer once said after recovery
from a similar illness, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had much
<i>constitution</i> since, but have been living mostly under the
by-laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>American office-holding in the Philippines is not so popular with
the Filipinos as to have moved them to any outburst of gratitude in the
shape of an effort to create a pension system for Americans who lose
their health in the government service out there. When they leave the
Islands they become as one dead so far as the Philippine insular
government is concerned. And <i>the men whose health is more or less
permanently impaired by disability incurred in line of duty in the
Philippines are not and will never be numerous or powerful enough back
home to create any sentiment in favor of a pension system for former
Philippine employees</i>, since the Philippine business is not a
subject of much popular enthusiasm at best. So if I had not had private
resources, the results of the Samar insurrection of 1904 would have
left me also in the pitiable plight in which I have beheld so many of
my repatriated former comrades <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb474"
href="#pb474" name="pb474">474</a>]</span>of the Philippine service in
the last seven years, to whom the heart of the more fortunate
ex-Filipino indeed goes out in sympathy. But to return to the race to
beat death to prisoners in that grim and memorable fall of 1904.</p>
<p>In September the crowded condition of the jail had begun to tell on
the inmates. The constabulary force at Catbalogan was quite inadequate
for the varied emergencies of the situation, there being, besides the
town itself to protect, the provincial treasury to guard, the
governor&rsquo;s office, the court-house, and the jail. Consequently
the jail guard was too small. The jail buildings were in an enclosure a
little larger than a baseball diamond, surrounded by high stone walls.
But it was not safe to let the inmates sleep out in the enclosure at
night. They had to be kept at night in the buildings. Any American who
has visited the central penitentiary at Manila called Bilibid has seen
a place almost as clean as a battleship. This is American work. But the
Filipinos are not trained in sanitary matters, and all they know about
handling large crowds of prisoners they learned from the Spaniards. The
Governor was a native half-caste, a very excellent man, but free from
that horror, which I think is an almost universal American trait, of
seeing unnecessary and preventable sacrifice of human life, no matter
whose the life. I inspected the jail as often as was practicable, and
managed to keep down the death-rate below what it might have been, the
prisoners being allowed to go out in the open court during the day.
They also had such medical attention as was available. However, during
the last five or six weeks of that term of court I would be pretty sure
to find on my desk every two or three days, on opening court in the
morning, a notice like this: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb475" href=

<p>Now a jail death-rate of only ten or twelve a month was not at all a
bad record for an insurrection in a Philippine province. It would be
rank demagoguery <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb476" href="#pb476"
name="pb476">476</a>]</span>at this late date to be a party to
anybody&rsquo;s getting excited about it. I was rather proud of it by
comparison with the jail death-rate of the Albay insurrection of the
year before, where 120 men had died in the jail in about six months.
But it began to get on one&rsquo;s nerves to have to expect a
<i>billet-doux</i> like the above on your desk at the opening of court
each day, when the accused person had had no commitment trial and may
have been wholly innocent. It all came back to the difference between
war and peace, viz., that in war it is to be expected that many
innocent persons will suffer, but that in peace only the guilty should
suffer. Moreover, in war that admits it <i>is</i> war, your agents,
your army, are better able to handle crowds of prisoners than native
police and constabulary, and the percentage of innocent who suffer with
the guilty in such war will be far less; whereas the contrary is true
of war&mdash;waged by constabulary checked by courts&mdash;which
pretends that a state of peace exists, <i>i.e.</i>, which pretends
there is no need for declaring martial law and calling on your
army.</p>
<p>It was this Samar insurrection which convinced me that waging war
with courts and constabulary in lieu of the recognized method was, in
its net results, the cruelest kind of war, and that the civil
government of the Philippines was a failure, in so far as regarded Mr.
McKinley&rsquo;s original injunction to the Taft Commission; where,
after alluding to the articles of capitulation of the city of Manila to
our forces, which concluded with the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">This city, its inhabitants *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and its
private property of all descriptions *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* are placed under
the special safeguard of the faith and honor of the American Army,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he added: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb477" href="#pb477" name=
"pb477">477</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">As high and sacred an obligation rests upon the
Government of the United States to give protection for property and
life *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* to all the people of the Philippine Islands. I
charge this commission to labor for the full performance of this
obligation, which concerns the honor and conscience of their
country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commenting on this in his inaugural address as Governor of the
Philippines, Governor Taft had said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">May we not be recreant to the charge, which he truly
says, concerns the honor and conscience of our country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No matter who was to blame, here we were in Samar, with the 14th
Infantry three hours away in one direction at Calbayog, doing nothing,
and the 18th Infantry five hours away in another direction, at
Tacloban, doing nothing, and a reign of terror going on in Samar, with
the peaceably inclined people of the lowlands and coast towns appealing
to us for protection and not getting it, sometimes crouching in abject
terror without knowing which way to fly, sometimes taking to the hills
and joining the outlaws as a measure of self-preservation. &rsquo;Twas
pitiful, wondrous pitiful! I then and there decided that we ought to
get out of the Philippines as soon as any decent sort of a native
government could be set up, and that our republic was not adapted to
colonization. In his <i>North American Review</i> article above cited,
in denying that the unwillingness of the Manila government to order out
the army in Samar in the fall of 1904 had anything to do with the
possible effect so doing might have had on the presidential election,
then in progress in the United States, Governor Ide rebuked me with
patronizing self-righteousness thus: &ldquo;Was Judge Blount opposed to
kindness?&rdquo; He means in giving the Filipinos, under such
circumstances, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb478" href="#pb478" name=
"pb478">478</a>]</span>the &ldquo;protection of civil
government,&rdquo; instead of ordering out the army. No, but I was
opposed to using a saw, in lieu of a lancet, in excising the ulcers of
that body politic at that time. In protesting that there was
&ldquo;nothing sinister&rdquo; about the failure to use the troops,
Judge Ide cunningly wonders whether my attitude was subsequently
assumed after I left the Islands because of &ldquo;proclivities as a
Democrat,&rdquo; or whether it was merely due to &ldquo;predilections
in favor of military rule.&rdquo; Read Mr. McKinley&rsquo;s
instructions to the Taft Commission, above quoted, that to protect life
and property concerned the honor and conscience of their country, and
consider if the Ide suggestion does not seem to hide its head and slink
away in shame before the strong clear light of what was then a plain
duty. As a matter of fact Judge Charles S. Lobinger, who is still with
the Philippine judiciary, visited me en route to another point, during
that Samar term of court, and he will recall, should he ever chance
upon this book and this chapter, with what vehemence I said to him at
the time, in effect, &ldquo;Judge, we belong in the Western Hemisphere.
We have no business out here permanently.&rdquo; If proclivities and
predilections in favor of affording decent protection to the lives and
property of defenceless people by properly garrisoning their towns
constitutes lack of kindness, then the Ide rebuke was well taken.</p>
<p>These details are not related with Pickwickian gravity in order to
acquaint the reader with <i>my</i> utterances as being important <i>per
se</i>. But it <i>is</i> important to make clear to the reader, and he
is entitled, in all frankness, to have it made clear by one who has now
so long detained his attention on this great subject, to know just when
&ldquo;the light from heaven on the road to Damascus&rdquo; broke upon
this witness, and how and why he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb479"
href="#pb479" name="pb479">479</a>]</span>came to be in favor of
Philippine independence, because the reasons which convinced him may
seem good in the sight of the reader also. If the man who reads this
book shall see that the man who wrote it was, in Samar in 1904, neither
a Republican nor a Democrat, but simply an American in a far distant
land, jealous of the honor of his country&rsquo;s flag in its capacity
as a symbol of protection to those over whom it floated, then the work
will not have been written in vain.</p>
<p>The presidentes or mayors of the various pueblos were in session at
Catbalogan in semi-annual convention during the first few days of
October, 1904, when the Assistant Attorney-General, Mr. Harvey, visited
Catbalogan. Mr. Harvey and the writer had taken a number of long walks
together in the suburbs of Catbalogan, though Major Dade, commanding
the Samar constabulary, an officer of the regular army, had warned us
it was not safe outside of town. We had talked over the situation
fully. Besides all its other aspects, there were a number of American
women in Catbalogan, an American lawyer&rsquo;s wife, the wife of the
superintendent of schools, her sister, and others. It was not at all
likely that the Pulajans would enter Catbalogan, but there was always
the <i>possibility</i>, not to be wholly ignored, that some such
episode as that of March 23d, of the preceding year, at Surigao,
already described, might be repeated. As hereinbefore noted, on August
9th, the Pulajans had done some killing and burning at Silanga, less
than ten miles north of Catbalogan and likewise at Motiong, less than
ten miles south of Catbalogan, on September 1st, and on the evening of
September 2d, about 7:30, there had been a false alarm caused by some
native of Catbalogan running down the main street yelling,
&ldquo;Pulajans! Pulajans!&rdquo; All of which did not tend to make you
feel <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb480" href="#pb480" name=
"pb480">480</a>]</span>that your American women were quite as entirely
safe from harm as they ought to be.</p>
<p>In the course of one of our walks Mr. Harvey and I had stopped on
the mountain side overlooking Catbalogan, to catch our breath and take
in the view of the town below and the sea beyond. I said to him,
because I knew his mind also was on the one great need of the hour:
&ldquo;Yes sir, if President Roosevelt were here, and could see this
situation as we do, he would order out the army and protect these
defenceless people, no matter which way the chips might fly.&rdquo; Mr.
Harvey agreed with me. He promised to go back to Manila and tell the
authorities there so. After we came back to town, we were advised that
the convention of presidentes desired to have Mr. Harvey favor them
with an address. He said, &ldquo;What shall I tell them?&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;Tell them that if they will do their duty by the American
Government, the American Government will do its duty by them.&rdquo; He
spoke Spanish fluently, made a good speech, and told them in effect
just that thing. Then he went back to Manila, and shortly afterward
wrote me the two letters which follow:</p>

submitted it to the attorney-general on the 12th, in the meantime
making a transcript of your summary and delivering a copy of same with
other information to the attorney-general along with my report. After
dictating the report and before delivering it I had a conversation with
General Allen on the situation in Samar and told him what my
recommendations would be. He agreed that rewards <span class=

Bulan, Antonio Anogar, and Pedro de la Cruz, but took issue on the
other recommendations, and to my mind he takes a very extreme view; but
I thought at the time and still think that he wanted to tone me down in
my feelings in the matter. I think the real cause for his opposition is
the effect that he fears an aggressive attitude might have on the
presidential election. In other words, whatever they do aggressively
might be misconstrued and made use of as political capital.</p>

convinced me that there would be something doing if it were not on the
eve of election, and in my opinion there will be things doing in Samar
within thirty days.</p>
<p>I inclose herewith a copy of your summary, and also a copy of my
report to the attorney-general. On the 18th instant I received your
telegram to hold the completion of your summary until receipt of a

situation will improve materially before that time. I would like to see

not affect the election a half-dozen votes, and it might save two or

<p>These two letters may be found at p. 2532, <i>Congressional
Record</i>, February 25, 1908, where they were the subject of remark in
the House of Representatives by Hon. Thomas W. Hardwick of Georgia,
apropos of Governor Ide&rsquo;s <i>North American Review</i> article of
December, 1907.</p>
<p>A few weeks after the presidential election I saw Mr. Harvey in
Manila. We naturally talked about Samar and his two letters to me. The
troops had then been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb483" href="#pb483"
name="pb483">483</a>]</span>ordered out. He referred to his conference
with the Governor-General and stated, &ldquo;Yes, he told me that was
the reason,&rdquo; meaning that the reason for not ordering out the
troops was the one assigned in his (Harvey&rsquo;s) letter to me, viz.,
&ldquo;Whatever we do aggressively might be misconstrued and made use
of as political capital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On October 18, 1904, there was received at Manila the following
cablegram concerning the presidential campaign in the United
States:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">New York, 16th. Judge Parker, in addressing campaign
clubs at Esopus the past week returned to the subject of the
Philippines in the evident hope of making it a paramount issue of the
campaign. He repeated his former declaration that the retention of the
Philippines and the carrying out of the policy of the Republican
Administration have cost six hundred and fifty millions of dollars and
two hundred thousand lives. Secretary of War Taft, in addressing a mass
meeting held in Baltimore, Saturday night, ridiculed Judge
Parker&rsquo;s statement and characterized his figures as alarmist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course Judge Parker&rsquo;s figures were rather high&mdash;of
which more anon. He was not going to miss anything in the way of a
chance of &ldquo;getting a rise&rdquo; out of the Administration, by
understatement. But some statement from the Philippines at once became
a supremely important desideratum, to counterbalance Judge
Parker&rsquo;s over-statement, some optimism to meet the Parker
pessimism. Encouraged by the public interest aroused by the figures
furnished him, and the consequent apparent uneasiness it created in
&ldquo;the enemy&rsquo;s camp,&rdquo; Judge Parker soon had the whole
Philippine group of islands going to &ldquo;the demnition
bow-wows.&rdquo; On October 20th, Secretary of War <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb484" href="#pb484" name="pb484">484</a>]</span>Taft
cabled Governor Wright, then Governor-General of the Islands, a long
telegram, quoting Judge Parker as having used, among other language
descriptive of the beatitudes we had conferred on our little brown
brother, the following: &ldquo;The towns in many places in ruins, whole
districts in the hands of ladrones.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11440src" href="#xd27e11440" name="xd27e11440src">15</a></p>
<p>At that time the whole archipelago was absolutely quiet for the
nonce, except Samar. Samar was the only island where Judge
Parker&rsquo;s statement was true, and as to Samar, it was absolutely
true. On October 23d Governor Wright wired Secretary of War Taft as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">There is nothing warranting the statement that towns
are in ruins. It is not true that there are whole districts in the
hands of ladrones. Life and property are as safe here as in the United
States.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11451src" href="#xd27e11451" name=
"xd27e11451src">16</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was followed by a perfectly true and correct picture of the
peace and quiet which then prevailed for the time being everywhere
throughout the archipelago, except in Samar, which dark and bloody isle
was specifically excepted. Then followed a statement as to Samar, full
of allusions as elaborately optimistic as any of the Taft cablegrams of
1900, to impliedly inconsiderable &ldquo;prowling bands&rdquo; of
outlaws in Samar. Of course nobody at home knew the answer to this, so
it silenced the Parker batteries, and the Samar massacres proceeded
unchecked. Meanwhile the 14th Infantry at Calbayog, Samar, and the 18th
Infantry, at Tacloban, Leyte, smiled with astute, if contemptuous,
tolerance, at the self-inflicted impotence of a republic trying to make
conquered subjects behave without colliding too violently with home
sentiment <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb485" href="#pb485" name=
"pb485">485</a>]</span>against <i>having</i> conquered subjects; sang
their favorite barrack room song,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">He may be a brother of Wm. H. Taft,</p>
<p class="line">But he ain&rsquo;t no friend of mine;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">and continued to enjoy enforced leisure. They
<i>did</i> chafe under the restraint, but it at least relieved them
from the not altogether inspiring task of chasing Pulajans through
jungles and along the slippery mire of precipitous mountain trails, and
at the same time permitted the secondest second lieutenant among them
to swear fierce <i>blas&eacute;</i> oaths, not wholly unjustified,
about how much better he could run the Islands than they were being
run.</p>
<p>On October 26th, I wired Governor Wright at Manila as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Since my letter of October 6th, situation appears
worse. Additional depredations both on east and west coast. Smith-Bell
closing out.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11480src" href="#xd27e11480"
name="xd27e11480src">17</a> Reliable American residing in Wright says
that during week ending last Sunday thirteen families living along
river Nacbac, <i>barrio</i> of Tutubigan, said pueblo, kidnapped by
brigands and carried off to hills. This means some sixty people having
farms along river, rice ready to be harvested. Seven of the eleven
<i>barrios</i> of Wright have been burned.</p>
<p class="signed"><span class="sc">Blount.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I sent that telegram of October 26th, the situation in the
pueblo of Wright was typical of the reign of terror throughout the
island. Wright could have been reached by the 18th Infantry (then over
at Tacloban, in Leyte), and garrisoned on eight hours&rsquo; notice.
But I had little hope that the telegram would <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb486" href="#pb486" name="pb486">486</a>]</span>stir
the 18th. The best man I had ever personally known well in high station
was at the head of the government of the Islands, and as he was my
friend, I sat down to think the situation out, determined, with the
prejudice which is the privilege of friendship, to analyze his apparent
apathy, and to conjecture <i>how many times</i> thirteen families
&ldquo;having farms along river, rice ready to be harvested&rdquo;
would have to be carried off to the hills by the brigands in order to
move the 18th Infantry before the presidential election. Then I
wondered just how many seconds it would have taken a British
governor-general, backed by unanimous home sentiment concerning the
wisdom of having colonies, to have acted, had a great British colonial
mercantile house like Smith, Bell &amp; Co. appealed to him for
protection of its interests. And that brought me, there on &ldquo;the
tie-ribs of earth,&rdquo; as Kipling would phrase it, to the
fundamentals of the problem. The British imperial idea of which Kipling
is the voice and Benjamin Kidd the accompanist is based, superficially,
upon a supposed necessity for the control of the tropics by
non-tropical peoples, though fundamentally, it is an assertion of the
right of any people to assume control of the land and destinies of
another when they feel sure they can govern that other better than that
other can govern itself. Is this proposition tenable, and if so, within
what limits? Is it tenable to the point of total elimination of the
people sought to be improved? If not, then how far? How far is
incidental sacrifice of human life negligible in the working out of the
broader problem of &ldquo;the greatest good of the greatest
number?&rdquo; In his article in the <i>North American Review</i> for
December, 1907, Governor Ide makes exhaustive answer to &ldquo;the
doctors who for some months past, in the columns of the <i>North
American <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb487" href="#pb487" name=
"pb487">487</a>]</span>Review</i> and elsewhere, have published
prescriptions for curing the ills of the Filipino people,&rdquo;
including Senator Francis G. Newlands, Hon. William J. Bryan, and the
writer. In the course of disposing of the quack last mentioned,
Governor Ide gets on rather a high horse, asking, with much dignified
indignation, &ldquo;How many people in the United States would have
known or cared whether the army was or was not ordered out in Samar in
1904?&rdquo; I concede that the solicitude was a super-solicitude, as
do the Harvey letters, but like them, I must recognize its reality.
However, when Governor Ide reaches this rhapsody of conscious virtue:
&ldquo;It is inconceivable that the Commission could have been animated
by the base and ignoble partisan prejudices thus charged against
them,&rdquo; capping his climax by triumphantly pointing out that
&ldquo;Governor-General Wright was a life-long Democrat,&rdquo; he doth
protest too much. For the angelic pinions he thus attaches to himself
are at once rudely snapped by the reflection that a very short while
after his article came out in the <i>North American Review</i> Governor
Wright became Secretary of War in President Roosevelt&rsquo;s Cabinet,
and a little later took the stump for Taft and Sherman, in 1908.
Governor Wright did not stoop to deny or extenuate his share in the
matter, and I honor him for it.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11512src"
href="#xd27e11512" name="xd27e11512src">18</a> But to stick to your own
crowd and then deny afterwards that you did so&mdash;that is another
story. However, let us brush aside such petty attempts to cloud the
real issue, which is: How many people <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb488" href="#pb488" name="pb488">488</a>]</span>would Governor Wright
and Vice-Governor Ide have permitted to be massacred by the Pulajans in
Samar in 1904 before they would have ordered out the military prior to
the <span class="corr" id="xd27e11525" title=
"Source: presidental">presidential</span> election? Let us consider the
case, not with a view of clouding the issue, but of clearing it. The
truth is, Governor Wright was very gravely concerned about the Samar
situation from August to November, 1904. Of course it is due to him to
make perfectly clear that he did not realize the gravity of that
situation as vividly as those of us who were on the ground in Samar,
four or five hundred miles away. But the information hereinbefore
reviewed, conveyed to him by the Provincial Governor, by Mr. Harvey,
the Assistant Attorney General sent to Samar for the express purpose of
getting the Manila government in possession of the exact situation, and
by myself, was certainly sufficient to make him &ldquo;chargeable with
notice&rdquo; of all that happened thereafter, certainly chargeable
with knowledge of all that had happened theretofore. Of course there
was General Allen, the commander-in-chief of the constabulary, at
Manila, presumably speaking well of his command&mdash;the right arm of
the civil government&mdash;presumably giving industrious and tactful
aid and comfort to the idea that the authorities could afford to worry
along with the constabulary alone until after the presidential
election. But that could not discount the actual facts reported from
the afflicted province by the officials on the ground. General Allen,
it should be noted, remained in Manila all this time. So that any
Otis-like &ldquo;situation-well-in-hand&rdquo; bouquets he may have
thrown at his subordinates in Samar, and the situation there generally,
were mere political hothouse products, surer to be recognized as such
by the shrewd kindliness of the truly considerable man at the head of
the government than by most <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb489" href=
"#pb489" name="pb489">489</a>]</span>any one else he could hand them
out to. That man knew, to all intents and purposes, in the great and
noble heart of him, what was really going on in Samar. He knew that
massacres had been occurring, and that they were likely to keep on
occurring. In other words, he knew that <i>preventable</i> sacrifice of
life of defenceless people was going on, and that he could put a stop
to it any time he saw fit. The question he had to wrestle with was,
should he stop it, knowing the &ldquo;Hell fer Sartin&rdquo; the
Democratic orators in the United States would at once luridly describe
as &ldquo;broke loose&rdquo; in the Philippines? I insist that there is
no use for any holier-than-thou gentleman to become suffused with any
glow of indignant conscious rectitude based on the premises we are
considering. Better to look a little deeper, on the idea that you are
observing your republic <i lang="la">in flagrante colonizatione</i>,
with as good a man as you ever have had, or ever will have, among you,
as the principal actor. Governor Wright&rsquo;s course was entirely
right, <i>if the Philippine policy was right</i>. If his course was not
right, it was not right because the Philippine policy is fundamentally
wrong. Governor Wright of course believed that the Philippine policy
was right. I myself did not come finally to believe it was wrong until
it was revealed in all its rawness by the period now under discussion.
Of course the Governor did not vividly realize that the American women
in Catbalogan were not entirely safe. If he had, he would have rushed
the troops there, politics or no politics. But native life was
politically negligible. What difference would a few score, or even a
few hundred, natives of Samar make, compared with that pandemonium of
anarchy and bloodshed all over the archipelago which Messrs. Taft,
Wright, and Ide had long been insisting would follow Philippine
independence? Was the whole <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb490" href=
"#pb490" name="pb490">490</a>]</span>future of 8,000,000 of people to
be jeopardized to save a few people in Samar? That was the moral
question before the insular government, in its last analysis. And the
government faced the proposition squarely, and answered it
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I will go farther than this. If I had believed, with Messrs. Taft,
Wright, and Ide, that Philippine independence meant anarchy in the
Islands, and the orthodox &ldquo;bloody welter of chaos,&rdquo; I too
might have hesitated to order out the troops on the eve of the
election, and my hesitation, like theirs, might have continued until
the election was safely over. So might yours, reader. Don&rsquo;t be so
certain you would not. Practically absolute power, sure of its own
benevolence, has temptations to withhold its confidence from the people
that you wot not of. Don&rsquo;t condemn Governor Wright. Condemn the
policy, and change your republic back to the course set by its
founders. Give the Philippine people the independence they of right
ought to have, instead of secretly hoping to unload them on somebody
else, through the medium of your next great war.</p>
<p>The question of whether the troops should have been ordered out or
not at the time above dealt with is by no means without two sides. On
the &ldquo;bloody welter&rdquo; side, you have the well-known opinions
of Messrs. Taft, Wright, and Ide. On the other side you have before
you&mdash;for the moment&mdash;only my little opinion. So instead of
having in Governor Wright a Bluebeard, you simply have a man of great
personal probity and unflinching moral courage, following his
convictions to their ultimate logical conclusion without shadow of
turning, in the act of colonization. In other words, Mr. American, you
see yourself, as others see you. So face the music and look at
yourself. In your colony business, you are a house divided against
itself, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb491" href="#pb491" name=
"pb491">491</a>]</span>cannot stand. On the other hand, I knew the
Filipino people far more intimately than either Mr. Taft, Governor
Wright, or Judge Ide. I spoke their language&mdash;which they did not.
I had met them both in peace and in war&mdash;which they had not. I had
held court for months at a time in various provinces of the archipelago
from extreme northern Luzon to Mindanao&mdash;which they had not. I had
met the Filipinos in their homes for years on terms of free and
informal intercourse impracticable for any governor-general. It was
therefore perfectly natural that I should know them better than any of
these eminent gentlemen. I was not prepared to be in a hurry about
recommending myself out of office by assenting that our guardianship
over the Filipinos should at once be terminated, but I knew there was
nothing to the &ldquo;bloody welter&rdquo; proposition. The home life
of the Filipino is too altogether a model of freedom from discord,
pervaded as it is by parental, filial, and fraternal love, and their
patriotism is too universal and genuine, to give the &ldquo;bloody
welter&rdquo; bugaboo any standing in court.</p>
<p>But whosoever questions for one moment Governor Wright&rsquo;s high
personal character, simply does not know the man. To do so, moreover,
would fatally cloud the issue I have sought to make clear between his
view of the duty of our government and my own. In his moods that
reminded one of Lincoln, Governor Wright used to say:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot the organist, he&rsquo;s doing the best he
can.&rdquo; It is true that his answer to Judge Parker was not a full
and frank statement of the case. But did it lie in American human
nature, when your antagonist was recklessly over-stating the case in
the heat of debate on the eve of a presidential election, to take him
into your confidence and tell him all you knew, in simple trusting
faith that he would thereafter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb492"
href="#pb492" name="pb492">492</a>]</span>quit exaggerating? To permit
the dispute to boil down to the real issue, viz., how many lives it was
permissible to abandon on the &ldquo;greatest good to the greatest
number&rdquo; theory, would obviously jeopardize the existence of a
government which the Governor of the Philippines naturally believed to
be better for all concerned than any other. And there is your
cul-de-sac. <i>Hinc ill&aelig; lachrym&aelig;.</i></p>
<p>We can point with pride to many things we have done in the
Philippines, the public improvements,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11557src" href="#xd27e11557" name="xd27e11557src">19</a> the
school system, the better sanitation, and a long list of other benefits
conferred. But in the greatest thing we have done for them, we have
builded wiser than we knew. &ldquo;God moves in a mysterious way His
wonders to perform.&rdquo; In fourteen years we have welded the
Filipinos into one homogeneous political unit. In a most charming book,
entitled <i>An Englishwoman in the Philippines</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e11563src" href="#xd27e11563" name="xd27e11563src">20</a> we
can see our attempts to fit government by two political parties into
over-seas colonization caricatured without sting until we really remind
ourselves of a hippopotamus caressing a squirrel. In one passage the
British sister describes our programme as one &ldquo;to educate the
Filipino for all he is worth, so that he may, in the course of time, be
fit to govern himself <i>according to American methods</i>; but at the
same time they have plenty of soldiers to knock him on the head if he
shows signs of wanting his liberty before the Americans think he is fit
for it&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A quaint scheme,&rdquo; she na&iuml;vely
adds, &ldquo;and one full of the go-ahead originality of
America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more we teach the Filipinos, the more intimately <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb493" href="#pb493" name="pb493">493</a>]</span>they
will become acquainted, <i>in their own way</i>, with the history of
the relations between our country and theirs from the beginning,
including the taxation without representation, through Congressional
legislation (hereinafter noticed) placed or kept on our statute-books
by the hemp trust and other special interests in the United States. And
they will learn all these things in the midst of a &ldquo;growing gulf
between the two peoples.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11577src"
href="#xd27e11577" name="xd27e11577src">21</a></p>
<p>In fourteen years we have made these unwilling subjects, whom we
neither want nor need any more than they want or need us, a unit; a
unit for Home Rule in preference to alien domination, it is true; but,
nevertheless, a patriotic unit&mdash;one people&mdash;a potential body
politic which can take a modest, but self-respecting place in the
concert of free nations, with only a little more additional help from
us.</p>
<p>In the handling of an insurrection in any given province with courts
and constabulary during the first four or five years after the Taft
government of the Philippines was founded, the function of a
representative of the office of the Attorney-General, coming from
Manila to help the local prosecuting attorney handle a large docket and
a crowded jail, was by no means remotely analogous to that of a grand
jury. He originated prosecutions, found &ldquo;No Bill,&rdquo; etc.
When Mr. Harvey came to Samar, he came direct to the court room, and I
suspended the trial of the pending case, and, after greeting him, began
an informal talk which was akin to the nature of a charge to a grand
jury, putting him in possession of the general aspects of the uprising.
He was a very just and kindly man, and entered into the spirit of the
task. I elaborated on the class of cases <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb494" href="#pb494" name="pb494">494</a>]</span>where the defendant
claimed, as most of them did, &ldquo;Yes, I joined the band of
brigands, but I was made to do so.&rdquo; It was also indictable to
furnish supplies to the public enemy. This presented the class of cases
where the brigands would swoop down on a town and demand rice, and not
getting it, would sometimes kill the persons refusing it, and so
intimidate the rest into finding rice for them. Also there was the
class of cases where a man would claim to have been one of the
inhabitants of an unprotected town who had gone off to the hills in a
body, <i>for safety</i>, to propitiate the mountain people by becoming
part of them. This sort of thing at one time threatened to become
epidemic with all the coast towns. It did not, however. A <i>modus
vivendi</i> of some sort, sometimes express, sometimes merely tacit,
would be arranged between the coast people and the hill people. These
<i>modus vivendi</i> arrangements enabled the coast people to obtain a
certain degree of safety, in lieu of that we should have secured them
but did not, by making the hill folk believe that the coast men were
against us and for them. At one time the prosecuting attorney got hold
of evidence sufficient to authorize the issuance of a warrant for the
Presidente of Balangiga, the man supposed to have engineered the
massacre of the 9th Infantry in September 1901. I authorized the
issuance of the warrant for his arrest. But the native governor of the
province, and also Major Dade, the American regular officer commanding
the constabulary, satisfied me that we did not have force sufficient to
protect Balangiga from the Pulajans, if we arrested the presidente,
who, being <i>persona grata</i> to the Pulajans, was able to keep them
from descending on his town. To arrest him would therefore mean, in
their opinion, that the people of Balangiga would take to the hills for
protection, and join the hill folk, or Pulajans, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb495" href="#pb495" name="pb495">495</a>]</span>and
if a town as large as Balangiga set any such example all the coast
towns might follow it. So the supposed perpetrator of the 9th Infantry
massacre was allowed to remain unmolested. The American court was
impotent to enforce its processes.</p>
<p>In my mass of Philippine papers there is one containing a copy of my
remarks to the Assistant Attorney-General on his arrival at Catbalogan,
above referred to as <span class="corr" id="xd27e11603" title=
"Source: analagous">analogous</span> to a charge to a grand jury at
home. It is dated Catbalogan, Samar, September 28, 1904, and is headed:
&ldquo;Remarks by the court upon the occasion of the arrival of
Assistant Attorney-General Harvey, with regard to the recent
disturbances in Samar, and the cases for brigandage and sedition
growing out of the same.&rdquo; Certain parts of this
<i>contemporary</i> document will doubtless give the reader a more
vivid apprehension of the then situation than he can get from mere
subsequent description. Of course the visiting representative of the
Attorney-General&rsquo;s office was familiar in a general way with the
manner of the handling of the Albay insurrection in the previous year,
described in the chapter preceding this. In discussing the Samar
situation the &ldquo;remarks&rdquo; of the court contain, among other
things, this passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">In the cases growing out of the Albay disturbances
there were a great many people who strayed out to the mountains just
like cattle. They did not know why or whither they went. As to those
persons, Judge Carson, Mr. Ross, and myself were unanimous in the
opinion that some of them could be indicted under the vagrancy law.
There were others of a greater degree of guilt, but who did not appear
to have been what you might call ordinary thieves, and we were all
agreed to indict those under the sedition law, the limit of which is
ten years and ten thousand dollars. Thus you do not force upon a Judge
of First Instance the responsibility <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb496" href="#pb496" name="pb496">496</a>]</span>of sentencing a man
to twenty years of his life for a connection with bandits which may be
but little more than technical. Besides those two classes, there were
in Albay of course the bandits proper, to whom the <i>bandolerismo</i>
[brigandage] law was specially intended to apply. There cannot be any
doubt about the fact that this <i>bandolerismo</i> law is one of the
most stringent statutes that ever was on the statute-books of any
country. It is very far from the purpose of this court to attempt to
say what would be the wisest legislation, or to say that this is not
the very best legislation, under the circumstances. <i>How we
administer the several laws alluded to governing public order, will
settle whether or not substantial justice is done.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The men in the United States who in those days were slinging mud at
the Philippine trial judges as being &ldquo;subservient,&rdquo; wholly
missed the core of the whole matter. In the provinces where so many
heavy sentences were imposed, the real situation was that a state of
war existed, and the judges believed, and I think correctly, that they
were practically a military commission of one, and much more able to
give a prisoner a square deal, tempering justice with mercy, than
officers briefly gathered from the scenes of the fighting to act as a
military commission. We tried those men with as little prejudice as if
they had just come from the moon. Moreover, from the italicized
concluding words of the above excerpt from my talk to the Assistant
Attorney-General, it will be seen that the court had practically
unlimited discretion in the matter of punishment, and was, in fact,
about the only <i>court of criminal equity</i> in the annals of
Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence.</p>
<p>In the last analysis, the righteousness or unrighteousness of a
civil government in a country not yet entirely subjugated, depends on
whether more innocent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb497" href=
"#pb497" name="pb497">497</a>]</span>people suffer through completing
the work of subjugation with constabulary whose &ldquo;prisoners of
war&rdquo; are tried, to see what they may have done, if anything, by
one-man courts, or whether more innocent people suffer through
completing the work of subjugation as any other great power on earth
but ourselves would have completed it, with an army, trying the
prisoners by military commission. Unless you yourself were a traitor to
your country, you considered as criminal attempts to subvert your
government by cut-throats that no one of the respectable Filipinos,
from Aguinaldo and Juan Cailles down, would have hesitated to have shot
summarily. But you sought to make the punishment in each case fit the
crime, by ascertaining as dispassionately as if the defendant were
fresh from the moon, just what each accused man had himself done.
Either Aguinaldo, or an American military commission would have had
such people shot in bunches, as not entitled to be treated as prisoners
of war. The trouble with the civil government did not lie in its
judiciary, but in its constabulary. It was the physical handling of the
crowds of prisoners by the constabulary, and their failure, because not
numerous enough, to protect peaceably inclined people, which made it a
fact that turning the situation over to the military would have meant
less sacrifice of the innocent along with the guilty. It is much more
merciful to kill a few hundred people, as a lesson to the rest, and let
the rest go, with the clear understanding that if they insurrect again
you will promptly kill a few hundred more, than to permit a reign of
terror from one month to another and from one year to another, with all
the untilled fields, famine, pestilence, and other disease this
involves, merely in order to be able to invoke the blessing of the
Doctor Lyman Abbots of the world on a supposedly benign
&ldquo;civil&rdquo; government. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb498"
href="#pb498" name="pb498">498</a>]</span></p>
<p>In all my sentences, and in all his indictments, Mr. Harvey and the
writer sailed close to the wind, by holding only those responsible who
had taken active parts in the sacking and burning of villages and the
massacre of their inhabitants. I knew that sooner or later some
officious prosecuting attorney of less noble mould than Harvey would
ask me to convict some poor creature of brigandage for giving a little
rice to the brigands, and my mind was made up to refuse to do so, and
in so refusing to commit heresy once and for all by expressing my
sentiments, in the decision, concerning the failure to give adequate
protection to defenceless people, along the lines indicated in this
chapter. No such case was in fact presented. I broke down under the
strain of graver cases early in November and left Samar forever, bound
for Manila.</p>
<p>Before I left, the whole island was seething with sedition. I was
told by a credible American that the chief deputy sheriff of the court,
an ex-insurgent officer, one of the &ldquo;peace-at-any-price&rdquo;
policy appointees, had remarked among some of his own people where he
did not expect the remark to be repeated: &ldquo;I see no use
persecuting our brethren in the hills.&rdquo; The municipal officials
of the provincial capital, Catbalogan, were suspected by the native
provincial governor, and the latter in turn was suspected by the Manila
government. In fact the whole political atmosphere of the island had
become full of rumor and suspicion as to who was <i>for</i> the
government, and who was <i>against</i> the government. I left Samar,
November 8th, which was the day of the presidential election of 1904,
determined to try no more insurrections. By that time nearly everybody
in the island was more or less guilty of sedition, and I did not know
the method of drawing an indictment against a whole people.

familiar to a number of very dear mutual friends, I deem it due both to
them and to myself, in view of the contents of the preceding chapter,
to state <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb500" href="#pb500" name=
"pb500">500</a>]</span>that I see no reason why, in writing a history
of the American Occupation of the Philippines, I should omit or slur
the facts which convinced me that that occupation ought to terminate as
soon as practicable, and that any decent kind of a government of
Filipinos by Filipinos would be better for all concerned than the
McKinley-Taft programme of Benevolent Assimilation whereof Governor
Wright was the legatee. By the thousand and one uncandid threads of
that programme, slowly woven from 1898 to 1904, as indicated in the
first sixteen chapters of this book, Governor Wright had found himself
as hopelessly bound to concealment from the American people of the real
situation in Samar in the fall of 1904, as a Gulliver in Lilliput.</p>
<p>When I finally left Samar and came to Manila, in November, 1904, I
was not prepared to figure out how or how soon, the blunder we made by
the purchase of the Philippine archipelago could be corrected. But my
mental attitude toward the whole Philippine problem had undergone a
complete change. In 1901 Governor Wright, then Vice-Governor, had
written me: &ldquo;You younger men out here, who have cast your
fortunes with this country, are to be, in all likelihood, in the
natural course of events, its future rulers.&rdquo; Up to 1903 I had
clung to that idea with the devotion of what was really high and
earnest purpose, untroubled with misgivings of any kind. In November,
1903, in Albay, Judge Carson and myself had talked over the long
struggle of the civil government to walk without leaning on the
military, and, with the readiness of one vested with authority to
believe such authority wisely vested, and the readiness of a civilian
lawyer to jealously guard the American home idea that the military
should be subordinate to the civil authority, I had cordially agreed
with a sentiment one day expressed by Judge <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb501" href="#pb501" name=
"pb501">501</a>]</span>Carson concerning Governor Taft about &ldquo;the
splendid moral fibre of the man,&rdquo; meaning in keeping the military
from prancing out of the traces. After Governor Taft left the Islands
to be Secretary of War (December 23, 1903), and while I was still in
Albay, I had learned of the 120 men who had died in the Albay jail
while awaiting trial, and thereafter something of the magnitude of the
Ola insurrection there, and that had given me pause as to the practical
benevolence of the operation of &ldquo;a benign civil
government.&rdquo; Then the Samar massacres of 1904, and the gory
panorama I had there witnessed, had finally convinced me that a
republic like ours is wholly unfitted to govern people against their
consent. But I did not tell anybody in Manila all these things. I
simply pondered them. Grover Cleveland was the only man in the world I
would have liked to talk to just then freely and fully. And he was not
about. &ldquo;My heart was heavy with the fate of that unhappy
people&rdquo; as Senator Bacon had said in the Senate in 1902, after
visiting the Islands in 1901. I did not condemn Governor Wright. I
quite realized that I was &ldquo;up against&rdquo; about the largest
ethical problem of world politics, one on which the nations are much
divided, and that I was not infallible. I did not say to the Governor:
&ldquo;Governor, let&rsquo;s resign and go home and tell our people
that this whole business is a mistake.&rdquo; Nor did I ever lose faith
in Governor Wright personally. If I had, I might just as well have
said: &ldquo;After this, the deluge.&rdquo; I would simply have lost
faith in human nature. I had not then, nor have I since, known a man of
higher personal character. I had simply lost faith in Benevolent
Assimilation, and begun to take the Filipino people seriously as a
potential nation, probably better able to handle their own domestic
problems than we will ever be able to handle them for them.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb502" href="#pb502" name=
"pb502">502</a>]</span></p>
<p>The day after I resigned, Mr. Justice Carson, of the Supreme Court,
and Mr. Wilfley, the Attorney-General, came to call on me. My friends
knew I was very much troubled over the Samar business. I was doing some
grumbling, but without specifying, because to specify would mean that
we all of us ought to give up the life careers we had planned for
ourselves in the Islands. I knew the old familiar answer a grumbler was
sure to get in the Philippines, viz., &ldquo;Old man, you&rsquo;ve been
out here too long. You better go home.&rdquo; But I did a little more
grumbling to my friends Judge Carson and Mr. Wilfley, during the course
of their visit. They could both pretty well guess what was the matter.
But Judge Carson and I had come out in 1899, and had served through the
war together. He knew all about the Albay business, and somewhat of the
Samar business. Wilfley had not come out until the civil government was
founded in 1901. Mr. Wilfley said cheerily: &ldquo;Oh, Blount, you are
too conscientious.&rdquo; I shall never forget what happened then.
Judge Carson said, with a ring of something like anger in his tone:
&ldquo;No, Wilfley, I&rsquo;ll be d&mdash;d if he is.&rdquo; Is it any
wonder that ever since I have worn that man, as Hamlet would say,
&ldquo;in my heart&rsquo;s core&rdquo;? Here was as brave and true an
Irishman as ever gained distinction on battlefield or bench. <i>And he
understood.</i> <i>He</i> did not say&mdash;which was the implication
of Wilfley&rsquo;s tone&mdash;&ldquo;Old man, you&rsquo;ve been out
here too long, and illness has made you peevish.&rdquo; He knew what
was the matter. He knew that as trial judges he and I had not been
small editions of Lord Jeffries, as some of our American critics had
implied, <span class="sc">BUT HE ALSO KNEW THAT THERE WAS NO METHOD OF
DRAWING AN INDICTMENT AGAINST A WHOLE PEOPLE</span>.</p>
<p>Possibly the intensity of my feelings on this great <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb503" href="#pb503" name=
"pb503">503</a>]</span>subject, then and ever since, hampers the power
of clear expression. Therefore, a word more in attempt at elucidation.
In 1898, Judge Carson and I, with many thousands of other young
Americans, had trooped down to Cuba, in the wake of the impetuous
Roosevelt, to free the inhabitants of that ill-fated island from
Spanish rule, drive the Spaniards from the Western Hemisphere, and put
a stop to Spain&rsquo;s pious efforts &ldquo;to spare the great island
from the dangers of premature independence,&rdquo; as she always
expressed her attitude toward Cuba. We had many of us been fired by the
catchy Roosevelt utterance which did so much to bring on the Spanish
War, viz., &ldquo;The steps of the White House are <i>slippery with the
blood of the Cuban reconcentrados</i>.&rdquo; Then in 1899, we had gone
to the Philippines, and had ever since been engaged there in
&ldquo;sparing the Islands from the danger of premature
independence,&rdquo; and the Samar massacres of 1904 were, to me, the
apotheosis of the work. So that after November 8, 1904, I felt
&ldquo;The steps of the White House are <i>slippery with the blood of
the people of my district</i>.&rdquo; It had all been done under the
pious pretence that the Filipinos welcomed our rule&mdash;a pretence
which had taken the form for six years of systematic asseveration that
they did so welcome it. Yet it was not <i>true</i> that they, or any
appreciable fraction of them, had ever welcomed our rule. <i>And it
never will be true.</i> Surely no man can see in this book any scolding
or unkindness. It is an attempt merely to bring home to my countrymen a
<i>strategic</i> fact, a fact which it is folly to ignore. But to
return to the thread of our story.</p>
<p>Four days after the presidential election of 1904, to wit, on
November 12th, Governor Wright left Manila and went to Samar, including
in his itinerary various <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb504" href=
"#pb504" name="pb504">504</a>]</span>others of the southern
islands.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11733src" href="#xd27e11733" name=
"xd27e11733src">3</a> Soon after their return, the seven hundred native
troops in Samar were increased to nearly two thousand, and sixteen
companies of regulars (say one hundred men to a company) were also
thrown into Samar. It took until the end of 1906 to end the trouble.
You cannot find in the reports of the civil authorities anything
explaining their three or four weeks&rsquo; stay in the Visayan Islands
in November&ndash;December, 1904, that is not absolutely in accord with
the original Taft obsession of 1900 about the popularity of the
proposed alien &ldquo;civil&rdquo; government with its subjects.
Governor Wright&rsquo;s description of the trip says: &ldquo;The warm
hospitality of the Filipino people made this trip of inspection a most
agreeable one.&rdquo; As a matter of fact, on such occasions, the more
disaffected a leader of the people was, the more he would seek, by
&ldquo;warm hospitality,&rdquo; &ldquo;warm&rdquo; oratory telling the
visiting mighty what the visiting mighty longed to hear, parades,
<i>fiestas</i>, etc., to divert suspicion of sedition from himself. The
poor creatures had met General Young&rsquo;s cavalry column in northern
Luzon in 1899 with their town bands, doing the only thing they knew of
to do to &ldquo;temper the wind to the shorn
lamb&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, to temper it to their several
communities&mdash;many of them doubtless expecting to be put to the
sword by General Young&rsquo;s troopers, as the Cossacks did the
Persians during the brief and sensational sojourn of that brilliant
young administrator, Hon. W. Morgan Shuster, in Persia in
1911&ndash;12. I have no doubt that high on the list of those extending
some of the &ldquo;warm hospitality&rdquo; above mentioned appeared the
name of Don Jaime de Veyra. Yet in the summer of 1904 Don Jaime had
gotten out of a sick bed to attend a convention <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb505" href="#pb505" name=
"pb505">505</a>]</span>called to send delegates to the Democratic
National Convention in the United States that year,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e11748src" href="#xd27e11748" name="xd27e11748src">4</a> and
also, in that same year, had run for Governor of Leyte on a platform
the principal plank of which was <i>Carthago est
delenda</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Carthago&rdquo; being <i>us</i>, the American
<i>r&eacute;gime</i>. De Veyra was defeated that time, but ran again
the next time and was elected. While the writer is not one of those who
seek to show their &ldquo;breadth of view&rdquo; by gossiping with
outsiders regarding what is peculiarly our own affair, still, the
British view-point of the situation in the Visayan Islands, as conveyed
by an Englishwoman whose husband was engaged in mercantile business
there in 1904&ndash;5, and who therefore was certainly in a position to
know the opinion of the little circle of British people at Cebu and
Iloilo, may not be superfluous here. This lady, living then at Iloilo,
wrote a series of letters to friends back home in England which she
afterwards published in book form.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11760src"
href="#xd27e11760" name="xd27e11760src">5</a> In a letter dated Iloilo,
January 22, 1905 (page 86), she says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The Americans give out and write in their papers that
the Philippine Islands are completely pacified, and that the Filipinos
love Americans and their rule. This, doubtless with good motives, is
complete and utter humbug, for the country is honeycombed with
insurrection and plots; the fighting has never ceased; and the natives
loathe the Americans and their theories, saying so openly in their
native press and showing their dislike in every possible fashion. Their
one idea is to be rid of the U. S. A. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and to be free of
a burden of taxation which is heavier than any the Spaniards laid on
them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb506" href="#pb506" name=
"pb506">506</a>]</span></p>
<p>Also an Englishman who was in Samar in 1904&ndash;5, a Mr. Hyatt,
who, with his brother, served with the American troops there in the
bloody Pulajan uprising, afterwards wrote a book called the <i>Little
Brown Brother</i>, wherein he fully corroborates Mrs. Dauncey&rsquo;s
appreciation of the situation during that period.</p>
<p>In its blindness to the unanimity of Visayan discontent, as
manifested in its report now under consideration, the civil government
of the Philippines was not trying wilfully to deceive anybody. It was
deceiving itself. It was obeying the law of its life, its existence
having been originally predicated on the consent of a great free people
to keep in subjection a weaker people eager to be also free, such
consent having been obtained through diligent nursing of the original
idea that the subject people were not in fact so eager, but were, on
the contrary, in a mental attitude of tearful welcome toward the
proffered protection of a strong power. In his report for 1905<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e11778src" href="#xd27e11778" name=
"xd27e11778src">6</a> General William H. Carter, commanding the
Department of the Philippines which included Samar and the rest of the
Visayan Islands, gives the key to the Commission&rsquo;s twenty-six-day
stay in his district in the following part of said report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Within a few days after the rendition of the annual
report for last year<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11786src" href=
"#xd27e11786" name="xd27e11786src">7</a> a serious outbreak occurred in
the Gandara valley, Samar. <i>This was followed by disorders in all the
other large islands of the department</i>, Negros, Panay, Cebu, and
Leyte.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nowhere in the civil government reports do you find the slightest
recognition that these disorders had <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb507" href="#pb507" name="pb507">507</a>]</span>any relation to each
other, or to the fundamental problem of public order, or any political
significance whatsoever, each being treated as a purely local issue,
the idea that the circumstance of Samar&rsquo;s having been thrown into
pandemonium by the successes of the enemies of the American Government
might have encouraged its enemies in the neighboring islands, never
seeming to occur to the authors of the said reports. General
Carter&rsquo;s report goes on to state that within five months after
the Samar outbreak of July, 1904, seven hundred native troops had been
put in the field in that turbulent island. In December, 1904, troops
began to be poured into Samar, so that it was not long before the seven
hundred native troops had become seventeen hundred or eighteen hundred,
and, says General Carter, &ldquo;in order to free them from garrison
work in the towns, sixteen companies of the 12th and 14th Infantry were
distributed about the disaffected coasts to enable the people who so
desired to <i>come from their hiding places</i>&rdquo;&mdash;whither
they had gone because the American flag afforded them no
protection&mdash;&ldquo;and undertake the rebuilding of their burned
homes.&rdquo; General Carter avoids touching on the civil
government&rsquo;s (to him well-known) obsession about its popularity,
a state of mind which could see no &ldquo;political&rdquo; significance
in outbreaks of any kind. But he does use this very straightforward
language about Samar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Whatever may have been the original cause of the
outbreak, it was soon lost sight of when success had drawn a large
proportion of the people away from their homes and fields.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* <i>Except in the largest towns it became simply a
question of joining the Pulajans or being harried by them.</i> In the
absence of proper protection thousands joined in the movement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb508" href="#pb508" name=
"pb508">508</a>]</span></p>
<p>Early in 1905, Hon. George Curry, of New Mexico, who was an officer
of Colonel Roosevelt&rsquo;s regiment in Cuba, and had gone out to the
Philippines with a volunteer regiment in 1899, remaining with the civil
Government after 1901, was made Governor of Samar. Governor Curry has
since been Governor of the Territory of New Mexico, and is now (1912) a
member of Congress from the recently admitted State of New Mexico.
Governor Curry has told me since he was elected to Congress that it
took him all of 1905 and most of 1906, aided by several thousand
troops, native and regular, to put down that Samar outbreak. Yet a
certificate signed March 28, 1907, by the Governor-General and his
associates of the Philippine Commission states that &ldquo;a condition
of general and complete peace&rdquo; had continued in the Islands for
two years previous to the date of the certificate.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e11811src" href="#xd27e11811" name="xd27e11811src">8</a> We
will come to this certificate in its chronological order later. How
many and what sort of uprisings were blanketed in that
&ldquo;forget-it&rdquo; certificate of 1907 is material to the question
whether or not the National Administration has ever been or is now
frank with the country about the universality of the desire of the
Philippine people for independence and local self-government, and
pertinent to the insistently recurring query: &ldquo;Why should we make
of the Philippines an American Ireland?&rdquo; But inasmuch as, in
addition to the Samar uprising which raged all through 1905, another
insurrection occurred in that year, which was duly
&ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; by said certificate, this last movement must
now claim our attention.</p>
<p>The provinces which were the theatre of the outbreak last above
mentioned were all near Manila. They were: Cavite, a province of
135,000 people almost at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb509" href=
"#pb509" name="pb509">509</a>]</span>the gates of Manila; Batangas, a
province of 257,000 inhabitants adjoining Cavite; and Laguna, a
province of 150,000 people adjoining both. Some five hundred brigands
headed by cut-throats claiming to be patriots were terrorizing whole
districts. Far be it from me to lend any countenance to the idea that
the leaders of this movement, Sakay, Felizardo, Montalon, and the rest
of their gang, were entitled to any respect. But they certainly had a
hold on the whole population akin to that of Robin Hood, Little John,
and Friar Tuck. In refusing in 1907 to commute Sakay&rsquo;s death
sentence after he was captured, tried, and convicted, Governor-General
James P. Smith gives some gruesome details concerning the performance
of that worthy, and his followers, yet in dealing with the nature and
extent of the trouble they gave the Manila government he says they
&ldquo;assumed the convenient cloak of patriotism, and under the titles
of &lsquo;Defenders of the Country&rsquo; and &lsquo;Protectors of the
People&rsquo; proceeded to inaugurate a reign of terror, devastation,
and ruin in three of the most beautiful provinces in the
archipelago.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11820src" href=
"#xd27e11820" name="xd27e11820src">9</a></p>
<p>It has already been made clear that, during the time of the
insurrection against both the Spaniards and Americans, the
<i>insurrecto</i> forces were maintained by voluntary contributions of
the people. Major D. C. Shanks, Fourth U. S. Regular Infantry, who was
Governor of Cavite Province in 1905, after calling attention to this
fact, adds<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11831src" href="#xd27e11831"
name="xd27e11831src">10</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">When the insurrection was over a number of these
leaders remained out and refused to surrender. Included among them were
Felizardo and Montalon. The system <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb510"
href="#pb510" name="pb510">510</a>]</span>of voluntary contributions,
carried on during the <i>insurrecto</i> period, was continued after
establishment of civil government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again Governor Shanks says, with more of frankness than diplomacy,
considering that he was a provincial governor under the civil
government:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The establishment of civil government of this province
was premature and ill-advised. Records show the capture or surrender
since establishment of civil government of <i>nearly 600 hostile
firearms</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the causes contributory to the Cavite-Batangas-Laguna
insurrection is stated in the report of the Governor-General for 1905
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">In the autumn of 1904 it became necessary to withdraw
a number of the constabulary from these provinces to assist in
suppressing disorder which had broken out in the province of
Samar.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11859src" href="#xd27e11859" name=
"xd27e11859src">11</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another of the contributory causes is thus stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">There was at the time [the fall of 1904] also
considerable activity among the small group of irreconcilables in
Manila, who began agitating for immediate independence, doubtless
because of the supposed effect it would have on the presidential
election in the United States, in which the Philippines was a large
topic of discussion. Evidently this was regarded as a favorable time
for a demonstration by Felizardo, Montalon, De Vega, Oruga, Sakay
[etc]. <i>All these men had been officers of the Filipino army during
the insurrection.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider the benevolent casuistry necessary to include these
fellows, and the tremendous following <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb511" href="#pb511" name="pb511">511</a>]</span>they could get up,
and did get up, in Cavite, &ldquo;the home of insurrection,&rdquo; and
the adjacent provinces, in a certificate to &ldquo;a condition of
general and complete peace&rdquo; alleged in the certificate to have
prevailed for two years prior to March 28, 1907. To make a long story
short, on January 31, 1905, a state of insurrection was declared to
exist, the writ of habeas corpus was suspended in Cavite and Batangas,
the regular army of the United States was ordered out, and
reconcentration tactics resorted to, as provided by Section 6 of Act
781 of the Commission. This is the act already examined at length,
intended to meet cases of impotency on the part of the insular
government to protect life and property in any other way. Political
timidity is conspicuously absent from the resolution of the Philippine
Commission of January 31, 1905, formally recognizing a break in the
peerless continuity of the &ldquo;general and complete peace.&rdquo; It
is virilely frank, the presidential election being then safely
over.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11876src" href="#xd27e11876" name=
"xd27e11876src">12</a> It concludes by authorizing the Governor-General
to suspend the writ of habeas corpus and declare martial law,
&ldquo;the public safety requiring it.&rdquo; Then follows a
proclamation of the same date and tenor, by the Governor-General.</p>
<p>It appears from the case cited in the foot-note that in the spring
of 1905, one, Felix Barcelon, filed in the proper court a petition for
the writ of habeas corpus, alleging that he was one of the
reconcentrados corralled and &ldquo;detained and restrained of his
liberty at the town of Batangas, in the province of Batangas,&rdquo; by
one of Colonel Baker&rsquo;s constabulary minions down there. The writ
was denied by the lower court. In one part of the opinion of the
Supreme Court in the case it is stated (p. 116) that the petitioner
&ldquo;has been detained <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb512" href=
"#pb512" name="pb512">512</a>]</span>for a long time *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
not for the commission of any crime and by due process of law, but
apparently for the purpose of protecting him.&rdquo; The opinion of the
court, delivered by Mr. Justice Johnson, very properly held that the
detention was lawful <i>under the war power</i>, basing its decision on
the authority conferred on the Governor-General of the Philippines by
the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, section 5 of which expressly
authorizes the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus &ldquo;when in
cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion the public safety may
require it.&rdquo; A long legal battle was fought, the court holding
that the Executive Department of the Government is the one in which is
vested the exclusive right to say when &ldquo;a state of rebellion,
insurrection, or invasion&rdquo; exists, and that when it so formally
declares, <i>that settles the fact that it does exist</i>. At page 98
of the volume above cited<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11895src" href=
"#xd27e11895" name="xd27e11895src">13</a> the court held, as to the
above mentioned resolution of the Philippine Commission and the above
mentioned executive order declaring a state of insurrection in Cavite
and Batangas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The conclusion set forth in the said resolution and
the said executive order, as to the fact that there existed in the
provinces of Cavite and Batangas open insurrection against the
constituted authorities, was a conclusion entirely within the
discretion of the legislative and executive branches of the Government,
after an investigation of the facts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet two years later the same &ldquo;constituted authorities&rdquo;
certified to the President of the United States, in effect, as we shall
see, that no open insurrection against the constituted authorities had
occurred during the preceding two years. They do not in their
certificate ignore Cavite and Batangas. They mention <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb513" href="#pb513" name="pb513">513</a>]</span>them
by name, with a lot of whereases, explaining that after all they really
believe that the majority of the people in the provinces aforesaid were
not in sympathy with the uprising. However, after they get through with
their whereases they face the music squarely, and certify to &ldquo;the
condition of general and complete peace.&rdquo; Of the &ldquo;nigger in
the woodpile&rdquo; more anon.</p>
<p>Governor Wright was not a party to the certificate of 1907. He left
the Islands on leave November 4, 1905. A speech made by him prior to
his departure, as published in a Manila paper, indicates an expectation
to return. He never did. In 1906 he was demoted to be Ambassador to
Japan, a place of far less dignity, and far less salary, which he
resigned after a year or so. Vice-Governor Ide acted as
Governor-General until April 2, 1906, on which date he was formally
inaugurated as Governor-General.</p>
<p>Just why Governor Wright did not go back to the Philippines as
Governor, after his visit to the United States in 1905&ndash;6, does
not appear. It would seem almost certain that if Secretary of War Taft
had wanted President Roosevelt to send him back, he would have gone.
Mr. Taft never did frankly tell the Filipinos until 1907 that they
might just as well shut up talking about any independence that anybody
living might hope to see. Governor Wright began to talk that way soon
after Mr. Taft left the Islands. Possibly Governor Wright undeceived
them too soon, and thereby made the Philippines more of a troublesome
issue in the presidential campaign of 1904. President Roosevelt
recognized the sterling worth of the man, by inviting him to succeed
Mr. Taft as Secretary of War in 1908. But President Taft did not invite
him to continue in that capacity after March 4, 1909. Gossip has it
that when the incoming President Taft&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb514" href="#pb514" name=
"pb514">514</a>]</span>letter to the outgoing President
Roosevelt&rsquo;s last Secretary of War, Governor Wright, was handed to
the addressee, and its conventional &ldquo;hope to be able to avail
myself of your services later in some other capacity&rdquo; was read by
him, the outgoing official quietly remarked: &ldquo;Well, that is a
little more round-about than the one Jimmie Garfield<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e11915src" href="#xd27e11915" name="xd27e11915src">14</a> got,
but it&rsquo;s a dismissal just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have always thought that the reason Governor Wright did not go
back to the Philippines as Governor after 1905 was that he did not
continue to &ldquo;jolly&rdquo; the Filipinos, and abstain from
ruthlessly crushing their hopes of seeing independence during their
lifetime, as Mr. Taft did continuously during his stay out there. The
inevitable tendency of the Wright frank talk was from the beginning to
discredit the Taft pleasing and evasive nothings. Also, it was
followed, as we have seen, by quite a crop of serious disturbances of
public order, and somebody had to be &ldquo;the goat.&rdquo;

and left the Islands finally in September thereafter.</p>
<p>All through 1905, Governor Curry, as Governor of Samar, which is the
third largest island of the archipelago, wrestled with the Pulajan
uprising there, aided, as has been stated in the previous chapter, by
the native troops, scouts, and constabulary, and also by the regular
army. But at the end of 1905 &ldquo;the situation&rdquo; was not yet
&ldquo;well in hand.&rdquo; Since his election to Congress in 1912,
Governor Curry has told me that in 1905 many thousands of people of
Samar participated actively as part of the enemy&rsquo;s force in the
field during that period. By the spring of 1906 Governor Curry was
getting a grip on the situation, and in the latter part of March of
that year, some of the main outlaw chiefs agreed to surrender to him.
The report of Colonel Wallace C. Taylor, commanding the constabulary of
the Third District, which included Samar states<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e11937src" href="#xd27e11937" name="xd27e11937src">1</a>:
&ldquo;After several weeks of negotiating, during which time the camp
of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb516" href="#pb516" name=
"pb516">516</a>]</span>Pulahanes was visited by Governor Curry, and the
Pulahan officers visited the settlement at Magtaon&rdquo;&mdash;a
settlement in south central Samar&mdash;&ldquo;an understanding was
arrived at by which the Pulahanes were to surrender, March 24, 1906.
Instead of surrendering as agreed, the Pulahanes, commanded by Nasario
Aguilar, made a treacherous attack on the constabulary garrison on the
day and hour appointed for the surrender.&rdquo; The constabulary
numbered some fifty men, the pulajans about 130. After the pulajans
opened fire they made a rush on the constabulary and a hand-to-hand
fight ensued. Colonel Taylor&rsquo;s report continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">After the first rush the fighting continued fiercely,
and when the last of the pulahanes disappeared there remained but seven
enlisted men of the constabulary able to fight. Seven more were lying
about more or less seriously wounded and twenty-two were dead. Captain
Jones received a bad spear thrust in the chest early in the fight, but
fought on, regardless. Lieutenant Bowers received a gunshot wound
through the left arm, which, however, did not put him out of the fight.
Thirty-five dead pulahanes were found on the field and eight more have
since been found some distance off. The number of wounded who escaped
cannot be determined. The unarmed Americans present with Governor Curry
escaped to the river and afterwards rejoined Captain Jones who armed
them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The explanation of this treachery, as given by Governor Curry, is
curious and interesting. The outlaws had intended in good faith to
surrender as a result of his negotiation with them, but at the last
moment there arrived to witness the surrender certain native officials
and other natives bitterly hated by the Pulajans and wholly mistrusted
by them. Their arrival caused the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb517"
href="#pb517" name="pb517">517</a>]</span>outlaws to suspect treachery
themselves and that was the cause of their change of plans. It was not
until the end of the year 1906 that the various energetic campaigns
which followed the Magtaon incident finally began to work more or less
complete restoration of public order by gradual elimination of the
enemy through killings, captures, and surrenders. An idea of the
seriousness and magnitude of these operations may be gathered without
going into the details, from the annual report for 1906 of General
Henry T. Allen commanding the Philippines Constabulary. This report,
dated August 31, 1906<a class="noteref" id="xd27e11952src" href=
"#xd27e11952" name="xd27e11952src">2</a>, states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">At present seventeen companies of scouts and four
companies of American troops under Colonel Smith, 8th U. S. Infantry,
are operating against the pulahanes, but with success that will be
largely dependent upon time and attrition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Allen adds: &ldquo;The entire 21st Regiment [of Infantry] is
also in Samar.&rdquo; These facts are here given because they relate to
the period covered by the certificate of the Philippine Commission of
March 28, 1907, heretofore alluded to, and which will be more fully
dealt with hereinafter, which stated that &ldquo;a condition of general
and complete peace&rdquo; had prevailed throughout the archipelago for
two years prior to March 28, 1907. Without a brief exposition of all
these matters, it would be impossible to enable the reader to feel the
pulse of the Filipino people as it stood at the time of the election of
their assembly in 1907. The fact of our having been unable to
discontinue Filipino-killing altogether for any considerable period
from 1899 to the end of 1906 is too obviously relevant to the state of
the public mind in 1907 to need elaboration. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb518" href="#pb518" name="pb518">518</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Report of the Philippine Commission for 1906<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e11967src" href="#xd27e11967" name="xd27e11967src">3</a> deals
at some length with disturbances which occurred in the island of Leyte
(area 3000 square miles, population nearly 400,000), beginning in the
middle of June. It describes among other things a visit of
Governor-General Ide to Tacloban, the capital of Leyte, made in
consequence of said disturbances, and conferences held by him there
with Major-General Wood, commanding all the United States forces in the
Philippines, Brigadier-General Lee, commanding the Department of the
Visayas (which included Leyte, headquarters, Iloilo), Colonel Borden,
commanding the United States forces in the island of Leyte, Colonel
Taylor, the chief of the constabulary of the District, etc. Certainly
from this formidable gathering of notables, it is clear that there was
about to take place in Leyte what our friends of the Lambs&rsquo; Club
in New York would call &ldquo;An all star performance.&rdquo; Leyte was
four to five hundred miles from Manila. Yet so serious was the
disturbance that the highest military and civil representatives of the
American Government in the archipelago deemed it necessary to meet in
the island which was the scene of the trouble with a view of handling
it. Yet in the Report of the Philippine Commission for 1906 one finds
the usual rotund rhetoric treating the disturbances as of no
&ldquo;political&rdquo; significance&mdash;which was only another way
of claiming that they were not serious. It is difficult to handle this
aspect of the matter without imputing to the civil authorities intent
to deceive, but to leave such an imputation unremoved would be to miss
the whole significance of the matter. As has already been made clear,
when Judge Taft, Judge Ide, and their colleagues of the Philippine
Commission had left Washington for Manila in 1900 Mr. McKinley had
assured <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb519" href="#pb519" name=
"pb519">519</a>]</span>them he had no doubt that the better element of
the Philippine people, once they understood us, would welcome our rule.
As soon as they set foot in the Philippine Islands they had at once
begun to act upon the theory that there was no real fundamental
opposition to us on the part of the people of the Philippines and had
continued obstinately to act upon that theory ever since. Certainly the
attitude of the civil government toward the disturbances in Leyte in
1906 is not surprising when the mind adverts for a moment to the
panorama of the five more or less sanguinary years already fully
described hereinbefore and then takes the following bird&rsquo;s-eye
glance at the official reports for those years.</p>
<p>The Report of the Philippine Commission for 1900, (page 17) had
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">A great majority of the people long for peace and are
entirely willing to accept the establishment of a government under the
supremacy of the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Report of the Philippine Commission for 1901 (page 7) had
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The collapse of the insurrection came in May.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Report of the Philippine Commission for 1902 (page 3) had
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The insurrection as an organized attempt to subvert
the authority of the United States in these islands is entirely at an
end,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>referring farther on to &ldquo;the whole Christian Philippine
population&rdquo; as &ldquo;<i>enjoying</i> civil government.&rdquo; If
the &ldquo;enjoyment&rdquo; thus described had been genuine, continued,
profound, and sincere, it would have been <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb520" href="#pb520" name="pb520">520</a>]</span>another story. But
the net attitude of the civil government toward the general health of
the body politic, relatively to public order, reminds one of the
cheerful gentleman who remarked of his invalid friend, &ldquo;He seems
to be &lsquo;enjoying&rsquo; poor health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Report of the Philippine Commission for 1903 (page 25) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The conditions with respect to tranquillity in the
islands have greatly improved during the last year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Report of the Philippine Commission for 1904 (page 1) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The great mass of the people, however, were domestic
and peaceable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Report of the Philippine Commission for 1905 (part 1, page 59)
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">On the whole life and property have been as safe as in
other civilized countries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Report of the Philippine Commission for 1906 (page 40) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Viewing the entire situation the islands are in a
peaceable and orderly condition aside from&mdash;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>various disorders which fill some ten pages of the report.</p>
<p>The inflexible attitude of the Commission from the beginning, of
treating each successive disturbance of public order as a purely
&ldquo;local issue,&rdquo; after General Hancock&rsquo;s method with
the tariff, is thus sufficiently apparent. They always refuse to see in
successive outbreaks in various parts of the Islands any evidence
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb521" href="#pb521" name=
"pb521">521</a>]</span>of general and unanimous lack of appreciation
for a benign alien civil government. Therefore it was of course clearly
a foregone conclusion, in 1906, that Governor Ide, who had been in the
Islands all these years, was going to be <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e12030" title="Source: wholely">wholly</span> unable to see
anything in the disturbances in Leyte in the least tending to show that
American rule was unpopular. And yet it was a matter of common
knowledge all over the Visayan Islands that Jaime Veyra, then Governor
of Leyte, elected by the people, was one of the most obnoxious
anti-Americans in the archipelago. Both the army and constabulary were
ordered out in Leyte and a good deal of fighting occurred before order
was restored. The report of General Allen, commanding the constabulary
for that year<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12033src" href="#xd27e12033"
name="xd27e12033src">4</a> shows one engagement with the outlaws in
Leyte participated in by the constabulary and the 21st Regular
Infantry, in which the enemy numbered 450 and left forty-nine dead upon
the field. All this period is covered by the certificate of general and
complete peace of 1907, in the fall of which year a Philippine
legislature was elected. And those of the membership of that body not
in favor of Philippine independence were almost as few as the Socialist
party in the American House of Representatives, which, I believe,
consists of Representative Berger. True, the peace certificate does not
ignore the Leyte outbreak. It &ldquo;forgets and forgives it,&rdquo; so
to speak, as we shall see.</p>
<p>Governor Ide left the Islands finally on September 20, 1906, having
resigned. Why he should have resigned, it is difficult to say. Take it
all in all, he made a splendid Governor-General, and ought to have been
allowed to remain. He knew the Islands from Alpha to Omega and had been
there six years. His going out of office to make way for still another
Governor-General <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb522" href="#pb522"
name="pb522">522</a>]</span>was wholly uncalled for. So far as the
writer is informed, he was, when he left, still blessed with good
health. He had filled a very considerable place in the history of his
country most creditably. He had drawn up a fine code of laws for the
Islands known as the Ide code. He had made a great minister of finance,
successfully performing the perilous task of transferring the currency
of the country from a silver basis to a gold basis, and in so doing had
proven himself fully a match, in protecting the interests of the
Government, for the wiley local financiers representing the Hong Kong
and Shanghai Bank, the chartered bank of India, Australia, and China,
and other institutions run by experienced men of more or less piratical
tendencies. As Governor-General of the Islands, his justice, firmness,
and courtliness of manner combined to produce an administration in
keeping with the dignity of his great office. After returning to the
United States, he remained in private life for a time, and was finally
given a comparatively unimportant post as minister to a second-class
country, Spain, which post he still occupies (in 1912).</p>
<p>When, fresh from the memory of the Samar massacres of 1904, I landed
at Seattle, at the end of my last homeward-bound journey across the
Pacific, in April, 1905, one of the &ldquo;natives&rdquo; of Seattle
asked me: &ldquo;Have those people over there ever got quiet
yet?&rdquo; The question itself seemed an answer to the orthodox
official attitude at Manila, which had so long been elaborately
denying, as to each successive local outbreak, that such outbreak bore
any relation to the original insurrection, or was any wise illustrative
of the general state of public feeling in the Islands. At the time the
question was asked, the answer was, &ldquo;Not entirely.&rdquo; Not
until toward the end of 1906 did &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; become a correct
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb523" href="#pb523" name=
"pb523">523</a>]</span>answer to the question. In other words, there
were no more serious outbreaks after 1906, nor was a state of general
and complete peace ever finally established until then. Since 1906
there have been occasional despatches from Manila recounting small
episodes of bloodshed, several of which have had quite a martial ring.
These have related merely to the country of the Mohammedan Moros, who
are as wholly apart from the main problem as the American Indian to-day
is from our tariff and other like questions. The Moros are indeed what
Kipling calls &ldquo;half savage and half child.&rdquo; They never did
have anything more to do with the Filipino insurrection against us than
the American Indian had to do with the Civil War. <span class=

&ldquo;the resignation of the Hon. Henry Clay Ide as Governor-General
became effective, and on that date the Hon. James F. Smith was
inaugurated as Governor-General of the Philippine Islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The year 1907 will be known most prominently to the future history
of our Far Eastern possession as the year of the opening of the
Philippine Assembly, which momentous event occurred on October 16th.
But in the departments both of Politics and Psychology it should be
known as the year of the Great Certificate. The Great Certificate was a
certificate signed by certain eminent gentlemen on March 28, 1907,
which made the preposterous affirmation that <i>a condition of general
and complete peace</i> had prevailed throughout the archipelago, except
among the non-Christian tribes, for the two years immediately
preceding. Taken in its historic setting, that certificate can by no
possibility escape responsibility, as &ldquo;accessory after the
fact&rdquo; at least, to the pretence that a similar condition had
prevailed ever <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb525" href="#pb525" name=
"pb525">525</a>]</span>since President Roosevelt&rsquo;s final
war-whoop of July 4, 1902, published to the American troops in the
Islands on the day named. That war-whoop, it will be remembered, was in
the form of a presidential proclamation congratulating General Chaffee
and &ldquo;the gallant officers and men under his command&rdquo; on
some &ldquo;two thousand combats, great and small,&rdquo; and
declaring, in effect, that Benevolent Assimilation was at last
triumphantly vindicated, and that opposition to American rule was at an
end. The certificate of March 28, 1907, appears at pages 47&ndash;8 of
the <i>Report of the Philippine Commission for 1907</i>, part 1. If we
consider what is <i>now</i> going on in the Islands as
&ldquo;modern&rdquo; history, and the days of the early fighting as
&ldquo;ancient&rdquo; history, this certificate will serve as the
connecting link between the two. It furnishes the key-note to all that
had happened during the American occupation prior to 1907, and the
key-note of all that has happened since. Therefore, though somewhat
long, it is deemed indispensable to clearness to submit here in full
the text of</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">THE GREAT CERTIFICATE OF 1907</p>
<p>Whereas the census of the Philippine Islands was completed and
published on the twenty-seventh day of March, nineteen hundred and
five, which said completion and publication of said census was, on the
twenty-eighth day of March, nineteen hundred and five, duly published
and proclaimed to the people by the governor-general of the Philippine
Islands with the announcement that the President of the United States
would direct the Philippine Commission to call a general election for
the choice of delegates to a popular assembly, <i>provided that a
condition of general and complete peace with recognition of the
authority of the United States should be certified by the Philippine
Commission to have continued in the territory of the Philippine Islands
for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb526" href="#pb526" name=
"pb526">526</a>]</span>a period of two years after said completion and
publication of said census</i>; and</p>
<p>Whereas since the completion and publication of said census there
have been <i>no serious disturbances of the public order save and
except</i> those caused by the noted outlaws and bandit chieftains,
Felizardo and Montalon, and their followers in the provinces of Cavite
and Batangas, and those caused in the provinces of Samar and Leyte by
the non-Christian and fanatical pulahanes resident in the mountain
districts of the said provinces and the barrios contiguous thereto;
and</p>
<p>Whereas the overwhelming majority of the people of said provinces of
Cavite, Batangas, Samar, and Leyte have not taken part in said
disturbances and have not aided or abetted the lawless acts of said
bandits and pulahanes; and</p>
<p>Whereas the great mass and body of the Filipino people have, during
said period of two years, continued to be law-abiding, peaceful, and
loyal to the United States, and have continued to recognize and do now
recognize the authority and sovereignty of the United States in the
territory of said Philippine Islands: Now, therefore, be it</p>
<p>Resolved by the Philippine Commission in formal session duly
assembled, That it, said Philippine Commission, do certify, and it
<i>does hereby certify</i>, to the President of the United States
<i>that for a period of two years after the completion and publication
of the census a condition of general and complete peace, with
recognition of the authority of the United States, has continued to
exist</i> and now exists in the territory of said Philippine Islands
not inhabited by Moros or other non-Christian tribes; and be it
further</p>
<p>Resolved by said Philippine Commission, That the President of the
United States be requested, and is hereby requested, to direct said
Philippine Commission to call a general election for the choice of
delegates to a popular assembly of the people of said territory in the
Philippine Islands, which assembly shall be known as the Philippine
Assembly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb527" href="#pb527" name=
"pb527">527</a>]</span></p>
<p>Let us examine these amiable liberties thus taken with the facts of
history by men of irreproachable private character, briefly analyzing
their action. Such an examination and analysis are indispensable to a
clear understanding by a great free people whose proudest boast is love
of fair play, of whether the Filipino people, or any appreciable
fraction of them, have ever in the least consented, or do now in the
least consent, to our rule, as the small minority among us interested
in keeping the Islands, have systematically sought, all these years, to
have this nation believe. As the above certificate of 1907 was the last
hurdle that Benevolent Assimilation had to leap on the Benevolent
Hypocrisy course over which we had to gallop in order to get from the
freeing of Cuba to the subjugation of the Philippines, let us glance
back for a moment at the first hurdle or two, leapt when Mr. Taft was
in the Philippine saddle.</p>
<p>Judge Taft had said on November 30, 1900:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">A great majority of the people long for peace and are
entirely willing to accept the establishment of a government under the
supremacy of the United States<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12128src"
href="#xd27e12128" name="xd27e12128src">2</a>;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and, pursuant to that idea, he had set up his civil government on
July 4, 1901. He never did thereafter admit that he was mistaken in his
original theory, but kept on trying to fit the facts to his theory,
hoping that after a while they <i>would</i> fit. He &ldquo;clung to his
policy of disinterested benevolence with a tenacity born of
conviction,&rdquo; to borrow a phrase from Governor-General
Smith&rsquo;s inaugural address of 1907. But in this same inaugural
address of Governor Smith of 1907, you find, for the first time in all
the Philippine state papers, a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb528"
href="#pb528" name="pb528">528</a>]</span>frank admission of the actual
conditions under which the civil government of 1901 was in fact set up.
Says he:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>While the smoke of battle still hung over the hills
and valleys of the Philippines and every town and barrio in the islands
was smoking hot with rebellion</i>, she [the United States] replaced
the military with a civil regime and on the smouldering embers of
insurrection planted civil government.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12146src" href="#xd27e12146" name="xd27e12146src">3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That confession, made with the bluntness of a most gallant soldier,
is as refreshing in its honesty as the Roosevelt war-whoop of 1902.
There shall be no tiresome repetition here concerning the original
withholding of the facts from the American people in 1898&ndash;9, but
to place in juxtaposition Secretary of War Root&rsquo;s representations
to the American public in the year last named, and the actual facts as
stated <i>earlier in the same year</i> by General MacArthur, one of our
best fighting generals, during the thick of the early fighting, in an
interview already noticed in its proper chronological place, will
forever fix the genesis of the original lack of frankness as to
conditions in the Philippines which has naturally and inexorably made
frankness as to those conditions impossible ever since. As late as
October 7, 1899, Mr. Root&mdash;who had not then and has not since been
in the Philippines&mdash;had said in Chicago, in a speech at a dinner
of the Marquette Club:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Well, against whom are we fighting? Are we fighting
the Philippine nation? No. There is none. There are hundreds of
islands, inhabited by more than sixty tribes, speaking more than sixty
different languages, and all but one are ready to accept American
sovereignty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb529" href="#pb529" name=
"pb529">529</a>]</span></p>
<p>As early as the beginning of April, 1899, just after the taking on
March 31st of the first insurgent capital, Malolos, General MacArthur,
who commanded our troops in the assault on that place, had said, in an
interview with a newspaper man afterwards verified by the General
before the Senate Committee of 1902 as substantially correct:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">When I first started in against these rebels, I
believed that Aguinaldo&rsquo;s troops represented only a faction.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* <i>I did not like to believe that the whole population
of Luzon *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* was opposed to us</i> *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. But
after having come thus far, and having been brought much in contact
with both <i>insurrectos</i> and <i>amigos</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12176src" href="#xd27e12176" name="xd27e12176src">4</a> <i>I have
been reluctantly compelled to believe that the Filipino masses are
loyal to Aguinaldo and the government which he heads</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e12185src" href="#xd27e12185" name=
"xd27e12185src">5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The presidential election of 1900 had been fought out, in the midst
of considerable bitterness, on the idea that the Root view was correct
and the MacArthur view was altogether mistaken. So that after 1900, the
McKinley Administration was irrevocably committed to the Root
view.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12193src" href="#xd27e12193" name=
"xd27e12193src">6</a> The Philippine Government had, after 1900,
diligently set to work to live up to the Root view, and to fit the
facts to the Root view by prayer and hope, accompanied by asseveration.
Hence in 1901 the alleged joyous sobs of welcome with which the
Filipino people are, in effect, described in the report <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb530" href="#pb530" name="pb530">530</a>]</span>of
the Philippine Commission for that year as having received the
&ldquo;benign&rdquo; civil government, said sobs or other
manifestations having spread, if the Commission&rsquo;s report is to be
taken at its face value, &ldquo;like wild-fire.&rdquo; Hence also the
attempt of 1902 to minimize the <span class="corr" id="xd27e12198"
title="Source: insursurrection">insurrection</span> of 1901&ndash;2, in
Batangas and other provinces of southern Luzon, conducted by what
Governor Luke E. Wright, in a speech delivered at Memphis in the latter
part of 1902, called &ldquo;the die-in-the-last-ditch
contingent.&rdquo; Hence the quiet placing of the province of Surigao
in the hands of the military in 1903 without suspension of the writ of
habeas corpus, and the failure to order out the army in Albay in 1903
and in Samar in 1904. Hence also the prompt use of the army in Samar,
Batangas, and Cavite in 1905, after the presidential election was
safely over. Hence also the seething state of sedition which smouldered
in the Visayan Islands in 1906, punctuated by the outbreak in Leyte of
that year.</p>
<p>The psychologic processes by which the distinguished gentlemen who
signed the Great Certificate of March 28, 1907, got their own consent
to sign it make the most profoundly interesting study, relatively to
the general welfare of the world, in all our Philippine experiments so
far. They are the final flowering of the plant Political Expediency.
They are the weeds of benevolent casuistry that become from time to
time unavoidable in a colonial garden tended by a republic based on the
consent of the governed and therefore by the law of its own life
unfitted to run any other kind of a government frankly. These processes
find their origin in the provisions of the Act of Congress of July 1,
1902, known as the Philippine Government Act. Three days after
President Roosevelt approved the Act, he issued his proclamation of
July 4, 1902, above noticed, declaring <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb531" href="#pb531" name="pb531">531</a>]</span>the insurrection at
an end. Section 6 of that Act provided:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Whenever the existing insurrection in the Philippine
Islands shall have ceased, and <i>a condition of general and complete
peace shall have been established therein</i>, and the fact shall be
certified to the President by the Philippine Commission, the President,
upon being satisfied thereof, shall order a census of the Philippine
Islands to be taken by said Philippine Commission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This census was intended to be preliminary to granting the Filipinos
a legislature of their own, but as a legislature full of
<i>insurrectos</i> would of course stultify its American sponsors
before all mankind, it was announced in effect, in publishing the
census programme, that no legislature would be forthcoming if the
Filipinos did not quit insurrecting, and remain &ldquo;good&rdquo; for
two years. If they did remain good for two years after the census was
finished, then they should have their legislature. During the lull of
&ldquo;general and complete&rdquo; peace which, in the fall of 1902,
followed the suppression of the Batangas insurrection of 1901&ndash;2,
and preceded the Ola insurrection of 1902&ndash;3 in the hemp provinces
of southern Luzon, the Commission made, on September 25, 1902, the
certificate contemplated by the above Act of Congress, and the taking
of the census was accordingly ordered by the President of the United
States, Mr. Roosevelt, by a proclamation issued the same day.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e12218src" href="#xd27e12218" name=
"xd27e12218src">7</a> Section 7 of the aforesaid Act of Congress
provided:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Two years after the completion and publication of the
census, in case such condition of general and complete peace with
recognition of the authority of the United States <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb532" href="#pb532" name=
"pb532">532</a>]</span>shall have continued in the territory of said
islands <i>not inhabited by Moros or other non-Christian tribes</i>,
and such facts shall have been certified to the President by the
Philippine Commission, the President upon being satisfied thereof shall
direct said Commission to call, and the Commission shall call, a
general election for the choice of delegates to a popular assembly of
the people of said territory in the Philippine Islands, which shall be
known as the Philippine Assembly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On March 27, 1905, the President of the United States was duly
advised that the census had been completed, and on March 28th, the
presidential proclamation promising the Filipinos a legislature two
years later if in the meantime they did not insurrect any, was duly
published at Manila. It is true that there is no Philippine state paper
signed by anybody, either by the President of the United States, or the
Governor-General of the Philippines, or any one else, certifying to a
condition of &ldquo;general and complete peace&rdquo; between the
certificate to that effect made by the Philippine Commission on
September 25, 1902, above mentioned, which authorized commencing the
census (and was justified by the facts), and the presidential promise
of March 28, 1905, that if they would &ldquo;be good&rdquo; for two
years more, they should have a legislature. But the whole manifest
implication of the representations of fact sought to be conveyed by the
action both of the Washington and the Manila authorities at the date of
the presidential promise of March 28, 1905, is that a condition of
general and complete peace had obtained ever since the last certificate
to that effect, the certificate of September 25, 1902. Yet, as we saw
in the chapter covering the last year of Governor Wright&rsquo;s
administration, besides the Samar disturbances that lasted all through
1905, a big insurrection was actually <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb533" href="#pb533" name="pb533">533</a>]</span>in full swing in
Cavite, Batangas, and Laguna provinces, on March 28, 1905, had then
been in progress since before the first of the year, and continued
until the latter part of 1905, the then Governor-General, Governor
Wright, having, by proclamation issued January 31, 1905, declared
Cavite and Batangas to be in a state of insurrection, ordered the
military into those provinces, and suspended the writ of habeas corpus.
President Roosevelt&rsquo;s proclamation of March 28, 1905, can by no
possibility be construed as saying to the Filipinos anything other than
substantially this: &ldquo;You have not insurrected any since my
proclamation of July 4, 1902. If you will be good two years
<i>more</i>, you shall have a legislature.&rdquo; What then was the
Philippine Commission to do at the end of those two years, peppered, as
they had been, with most annoying outbreaks in various provinces not
inhabited by &ldquo;Moros or other non-Christian tribes.&rdquo; During
the presidential campaign of 1904 the Commission had committed
themselves, as we have seen, to the proposition that nothing serious
was going on at that time in Samar. So how could they take frank
official cognizance on paper of the reign of terror let loose there by
their delay in ordering out the army until after the presidential
election, a delay which, like a delay of fire-engines to arrive at the
scene of a fire, had permitted the Samar outbreak to gain such headway
that it took two years to finally put it down? Then there was the
outbreak of 1906 in Leyte, described in the last chapter, as to which
even the Commission had admitted in their annual report for that
year<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12240src" href="#xd27e12240" name=
"xd27e12240src">8</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Possibly its [Leyte&rsquo;s] immediate vicinity to
Samar has had to do with the disturbed conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb534" href="#pb534" name=
"pb534">534</a>]</span></p>
<p>In other words, <i>possibly</i>, a fire <i>may</i> spread from one
field of dry grass to another near by.</p>
<p>As to the Cavite-Batangas-Laguna insurrection of 1905, in an
executive order dated September 28, 1907,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12258src" href="#xd27e12258" name=
"xd27e12258src">9</a>&mdash;noticed in a previous chapter, but too
pertinent to be entirely omitted here&mdash;wherein are set forth the
reasons for withholding executive clemency from the condemned leaders
of that movement, Governor-General Smith describes in harrowing terms
&ldquo;a reign of terror, devastation, and ruin in three of the most
beautiful provinces in the archipelago,&rdquo; wrought by the condemned
men, who he says &ldquo;assumed the cloak of patriotism, and under the
titles of &lsquo;Defenders of the Country,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Protectors
of the People&rsquo; proceeded to inaugurate&rdquo; said reign of
terror. These men were most of them former insurgent officers who had
remained out after the respectable generals had all surrendered. This
Cavite-Batangas-Laguna insurrection was <i>the very sort of thing which
the conditional promise of a legislature made by Congress to the
Filipino people</i> in Sections 6 and 7 of the Act of July 1,
1902&mdash;the Philippine Government Act&mdash;<i>had stipulated should
not happen</i>. This is no mere <i>dictum</i> of my own. In the case of
Barcelon against Baker, 5 <i>Philippine Reports</i>, pp. 87 <i>et
seq.</i>, already very briefly noticed in a previous chapter, the
Supreme Court of the Islands had, in effect, so held. Section 5 of the
Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, had provided that if any state of
affairs serious enough should arise, the Governor of the Philippines
should have authority to suspend the writ of habeas corpus &ldquo;when
in cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion the public safety may
require it.&rdquo; Sections 6 and 7 of the same Act had provided, on
the other hand, that if a condition of general and complete peace
should prevail for a stated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb535" href=
"#pb535" name="pb535">535</a>]</span>period the Filipinos should have a
legislature. In the case of Barcelon against Baker the Supreme Court
held that the situation contemplated by Section 5 of the Act of
Congress had arisen in the provinces of Cavite and Batangas. That, of
course, automatically, so to speak, made the postponement of the
Philippine Assembly a necessary logical sequence, under the provisions
of Sections 6 and 7. These Sections 6 and 7 promised the Filipinos a
legislature in the event the conditions contemplated by Section 5
should not arise. Barcelon, who was one of the (non-combatant)
reconcentrados restrained of his liberty at Batangas, claimed that his
detention as such reconcentrado by the defendant in the habeas corpus
proceeding, the constabulary officer, Colonel Baker, was unlawful, in
that, he being charged with no crime, such detention deprived him of
his liberty without due process of law. The Philippine Commission,
however, had declared, by virtue of the authority vested in it by
Section 5 of the Act of Congress aforesaid, that a state of
insurrection existed in Cavite and Batangas, and accordingly the
Governor-General had suspended the writ of habeas corpus and declared
martial law in those provinces. The Attorney-General representing the
Philippine Commission before the court rested the Government&rsquo;s
case on the proposition that the petitioner was not entitled to claim
the ordinary &ldquo;due process of law&rdquo; because &ldquo;open
insurrection against the constituted authorities&rdquo; existed in the
provinces named. And the Supreme Court upheld his contention. In so
holding, they say, among other things (page 93), in construing Section
5 of the Act of Congress we are considering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Inasmuch as the President, or Governor-General with
the approval of the Philippine Commission, can suspend the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb536" href="#pb536" name=
"pb536">536</a>]</span>privilege of the writ of habeas corpus only
under the conditions mentioned in the said statute, it becomes their
duty to make an investigation of the existing conditions in the
archipelago, <i>or any part thereof</i>, to ascertain whether there
actually exists a state of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion, and
that the public safety requires the suspension of the privilege of the
writ of habeas corpus. When this investigation is concluded, and the
President, or the Governor-General with the consent of the Philippine
Commission, <i>declares that there exists these conditions</i>, and
that the public safety requires the suspension of the privilege of the
writ of habeas corpus, can the judicial department of the Government
investigate the same facts and declare that no such conditions
exist?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They answer &ldquo;No!&rdquo; The head note of the decision is as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus may be
suspended in the Philippine Islands in the case of rebellion,
insurrection, and invasion, when the public safety requires it, by the
President of the United States, or by the Governor-General of the
Philippine Islands with the approval of the Philippine Commission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus the Supreme Court of the Islands squarely held that <i>on the
fourth day of August, 1905</i> (the day the writ of habeas corpus was
made returnable), <i>open insurrection existed against the constituted
authorities in the Islands</i>, in the provinces named, <i>and had
existed since the Executive Proclamation of January 31st, previous,
declaring a state of insurrection</i>, and on that ground denied the
writ. Yet the Commission certified on March 28, 1907, that a state of
general and complete peace as contemplated by the Act of Congress
conditionally promising a legislature, had prevailed for the two years
preceding. In other words the Philippine <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb537" href="#pb537" name="pb537">537</a>]</span>Commission declared a
state of insurrection to exist in certain populous provinces, and was
upheld by the Supreme Court of the Islands in so doing, and later
certified to the continuance of a state of general and complete peace
covering the same period.</p>
<p>All the uncandid things&mdash;uncandid in failure to take the
American people into their confidence&mdash;that have been done by all
the good men we have sent to the Philippines from the beginning, have
been justified by those good men to their own consciences on the idea
that, because the end in view was truly benevolent, therefore the end
justified the means. As a matter of fact, American Benevolent
Assimilation in the Philippines has, in its practical operation, worked
more of misery and havoc, first through war, and since through
legislation put or kept on the statute books by the influence of
special interests in the United States with Congress, &ldquo;than any
which has darkened their unhappy past&rdquo; to use one of Mr.
McKinley&rsquo;s early expressions deprecating doing for the
Philippines what we did for Cuba.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12314src"
href="#xd27e12314" name="xd27e12314src">10</a></p>
<p>But let us see just how much the Philippine Commission that signed
the peace certificate of March 28, 1907, swallowed, and how they
swallowed it. It will be observed that they sugar-coated their
certificate with a lot of whereases. The first of these recites
President Roosevelt&rsquo;s promise of March 28, 1905, that the
Filipinos should have a legislature two years thereafter
&ldquo;provided that a condition of general and complete peace with
recognition of the authority of the United States should be certified
by the Philippine Commission to have continued in the territory of the
Philippine Islands for a period of two years&rdquo; after the
proclamation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb538" href="#pb538" name=
"pb538">538</a>]</span>Whereas number two, it will be noted, goes on to
state that there have been &ldquo;no serious disturbances of public
order save and except&rdquo; those in Cavite, Batangas, Samar, and
Leyte,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12324src" href="#xd27e12324" name=
"xd27e12324src">11</a> the magnitude of which has been fully described
in previous chapters. Of the Cavite-Batangas insurrection, the only one
they had previously formally admitted to <i>be</i> an insurrection,
they say it was &ldquo;caused by certain noted outlaws and bandit
chieftains [naming them], and their followers.&rdquo; Obviously this
was hardly sufficient to show that an insurrection they had once
officially recognized as such was not in fact such at all. So in order
to justify a statement that &ldquo;a condition of general and complete
peace&rdquo; had continued in these two great provinces of Cavite and
Batangas, which they had but shortly previously declared to be in a
state of insurrection, and been upheld by the Supreme Court in so
doing, they resort to the old Otis expedient of 1898&ndash;9, worked on
the American people through Mr. McKinley to show absence of lack of
consent-of-the-governed. This expedient, as we have seen in the earlier
chapters of this book, consisted in vague use of the word
&ldquo;majority.&rdquo; It had stood Judge Taft in good stead in the
campaign of 1900, because when he then said that &ldquo;the great
majority of the people&rdquo; were &ldquo;entirely willing&rdquo; to
accept American rule, there was no earthly way to disprove it in time
for the verdict of the American people to be influenced by the
unanimity of the Filipinos against a change of masters in lieu of
independence. It was the only possible expedient for an American
conscience, because every American naturally feels that unless he can,
by some sort of sophistry, persuade himself that &ldquo;the
majority&rdquo; of the people want a given thing, then the thing is a
wrong thing to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb539" href="#pb539" name=
"pb539">539</a>]</span>force upon them. So the ethical hurdle the
Commission had to leap in order to sign the certificate of 1907 was
cleared thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The overwhelming majority of the people of said
provinces have not taken part in said disturbances and have not aided
and abetted the lawless acts of said bandits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a matter of fact, the report of the American Governor of
Cavite&mdash;and conditions were conceded to be identical in the two
provinces of Cavite and Batangas&mdash;shows that the reason it was so
hard to suppress the Cavite-Batangas troubles of 1905 was that the
people would not help the authorities to apprehend the outlaws. No
doubt the King of England would have signed a similar certificate as to
the people of the shires and counties in which Robin Hood, Little John,
and Friar Tuck, held high carnival. Of course I do not mean to libel
the fair fame of that fine freebooter Robin Hood and his companions by
placing the rascally leaders of the bands of outlaws now under
consideration in the same jolly and respectable class with those
beloved friends of the childhood of us all. But the Cavite-Batangas
&ldquo;patriots&rdquo; of 1905 could never have given the authorities
as much trouble as they did if the people had not at least taken secret
joy in discomfiture of the American authorities. Until finally
suppressed, all such movements as these always grew exactly as a
snow-ball does if you roll it on snow. Says Governor Shanks, a Major of
the 4th United States Infantry, who was Governor of Cavite, in 1905 in
his report for that year,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12338src" href=
"#xd27e12338" name="xd27e12338src">12</a> in explaining the uprising
under consideration, and the way it grew: &ldquo;The Filipino likes to
be on the winning side.&rdquo; Certainly this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb540" href="#pb540" name="pb540">540</a>]</span>is
not peculiar to the Filipino. Governor Shanks proceeds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The prestige acquired (by the uprising) at San Pedro
Tunasan, Paranaque, Taal, and San Francisco de Malabon had great weight
in creating active sympathy for ladrone bands and leaders. Something
was needed to counterbalance the effect of their combined successes,
and the appearance of regular troops was just the thing needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This explains how &ldquo;the overwhelming majority&rdquo; of which
the certificate of 1907 speaks was obtained in Cavite. It took six
months to obtain said &ldquo;majority&rdquo; at that. I suppose the
campaigning of the American regulars might be credited with obtaining
the &ldquo;majority,&rdquo; and the reconcentration of brother Baker of
the constabulary might be accorded the additional credit of making the
majority &ldquo;overwhelming.&rdquo; If you have, as election tellers,
so to speak, a soldier with a bayonet on one side, and a constabulary
officer with a reconcentration camp back of him on the other, you can
get an &ldquo;overwhelming majority&rdquo; for the continuance of
American rule even in Cavite province.</p>
<p>Through men I commanded during the early campaigning, I have killed
my share of Filipinos in the time of war; and after the civil
government was set up I had occasion to hang a good many of them, under
what seemed to me a necessary application of the old Mosaic law,
&ldquo;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and a life for a
life.&rdquo; But I thank God I have never been a party to the
insufferable pretence that they, or any appreciable fraction of them,
ever consented to our rule. This, however, is the whole theory of the
Philippine Commission&rsquo;s certificate of March 28, 1907. It is
curious how generously and supremely frank a brave soldier will get
when he forgets to be a politician. In <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb541" href="#pb541" name="pb541">541</a>]</span>one of his state
papers of 1907 Governor-General Smith<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12356src" href="#xd27e12356" name="xd27e12356src">13</a> speaks
of General Trias, who had been Lieutenant-General of the insurgent army
in the days of the insurrection, and next in rank to Aguinaldo himself,
as one &ldquo;whose love of country had been tested on many a well
fought field of honorable conflict.&rdquo; Contrast this tribute to the
respectability of the original Philippine war for independence against
us with the long list of stale falsehoods already reviewed in this
volume, on the faith of which, in the presidential campaign of 1900,
the American people were persuaded that to deny to the Filipinos what
they had accorded to Cuba was righteous! The leaders of the
Cavite-Batangas uprising of 1905 had been officers of the insurgent
army, and that was the secret of their hold upon the people of those
provinces. It is true that they must have been pretty sorry officers,
and that they were <i>ladrones</i> (brigands). They were cruel and
unmitigated scoundrels working for purely selfish and vainglorious
ends. But it was the cloak of patriotism, however, infamously misused,
that gained them such success as they attained in 1905. Says the
American Governor of Cavite province in his annual report for
1906<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12364src" href="#xd27e12364" name=
"xd27e12364src">14</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The province should be most carefully watched. I am
convinced that <i>ladrone leaders do not produce conditions</i>, but
that <i>the conditions and attitude of the public produce
ladrones</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So much for the Cavite-Batangas hurdle. And now as to the Samar and
Leyte hurdle.</p>
<p>The signers of the certificate of 1907 justify their certificate as
to Samar and Leyte on a very ingenious theory. The Act of Congress of
July 1, 1902, already <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb542" href=
"#pb542" name="pb542">542</a>]</span>cited, which had provided for the
taking of a census preliminary to the call of an election for delegates
to a legislature, had recognized the crude ethnological status of the
Moros and other non-Christian tribes. These had never had anything
whatever to do with the insurrection against us. Therefore in making
the continuance of a state of general and complete peace for a
prescribed period a condition precedent to granting the Filipinos a
legislature, the Act of 1902 had limited that condition precedent to
&ldquo;the territory of said Islands not inhabited by Moros or other
non-Christian tribes.&rdquo; In fact President Roosevelt&rsquo;s
proclamation of September 25, 1902, already noticed, ordering the
taking of the census on the theory that a state of general and complete
peace then existed, explains that this theory is entirely consistent
with trouble among the Moros and other non-Christian tribes because
<i>they</i>, it says, quoting from a statement of the Philippine
Commission previously made to the President, &ldquo;never have taken
any part in the insurrection.&rdquo; The Moros and other non-Christian
tribes were, so to speak, in no sense assets of the Philippine
insurrection. All the rest of the population was&mdash;that is, if
there was anything in the veteran General MacArthur&rsquo;s grim jest
of 1900, prompted by Governor Taft&rsquo;s half-baked opinion to the
contrary, that &ldquo;ethnological homogeneity&rdquo; was the secret of
the unanimity of the opposition we met, and that somehow people
&ldquo;<i>will</i> stick to their own kith and kin.&rdquo; When the
Philippine Government Act of 1902 was drawn nobody pretended for a
moment that there were any non-Christian tribes either in Samar or
Leyte. The whole population of those Islands were valuable
<i>assets</i> of the insurrection. If any one doubts it, let him ask
the 9th Infantry. You will find in the Census of 1903 <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb543" href="#pb543" name="pb543">543</a>]</span>that
there are no non-Christian tribes credited either to Samar or
Leyte.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12397src" href="#xd27e12397" name=
"xd27e12397src">15</a> When the Philippine Government Act of 1902 was
drafted, the exception about Moros and other non-Christian tribes was
intended to except merely certain types of people as distinct from the
great mass of the Philippine population as islands are from the sea.
The fact is, no person connected with the Philippine Government
<i>either before or after</i> the certificate under consideration, ever
thought of classifying the ignorant country people of the uplands and
hills of Samar or Leyte, as &ldquo;non-Christian tribes.&rdquo; The
Philippine Census of 1903 does not so classify them. The very volume of
the <i>Report of the Philippine Commission for 1907</i> in which the
certificate aforesaid appears, does not. In that volume,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e12412src" href="#xd27e12412" name=
"xd27e12412src">16</a> the report of the Executive Secretary deals
elaborately with the subject of non-Christian tribes. Professor
Worcester of the Philippine Commission has for the last twelve years
been the grand official digger-up of non-Christian tribes. He takes as
much delight at the discovery of a new non-Christian tribe in some
remote, newly penetrated mountain fastness, as the butterfly catcher
with the proverbial blue goggles does in the capture of a new kind of
butterfly. The Executive Secretary&rsquo;s report, out of deference to
the professor, omits no single achievement of his with reference to his
anthropological hobby. It treats, with an enthusiasm that would delight
Mrs. Jellyby herself, of &ldquo;the progress that was made during the
fiscal year in the work of civilizing non-Christian tribes
<i>scattered</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb544" href="#pb544"
name="pb544">544</a>]</span>throughout the archipelago.&rdquo; It gives
an alphabetical list of all the provinces where there are non-Christian
tribes, and, under the name of each province it gives notes as to the
progress during the year with those tribes. <i>Neither Samar nor Leyte
appear in that list of provinces.</i> So that the Samar
&ldquo;Pulajans,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Red Breeches&rdquo;
fellows,&mdash;&ldquo;fanatical&rdquo; Pulajans, they are called in the
certificate&mdash;were &ldquo;non-Christian tribes&rdquo; for peace
certificate purposes only. One thing which makes it most difficult of
all for me to understand how these gentlemen got their consent to sign
that certificate is that each non-Christian tribe in the Philippines
has a language of its own, whereas the country people of the uplands
and mountains of Samar and Leyte who are labelled&mdash;or
libelled&mdash;&ldquo;non-Christian tribes&rdquo; in the certificate of
1907, were no more different from the rest of the population of those
islands than, for instance, the ignorant mountain people of Virginia or
Kentucky are different, ethnologically, from the inhabitants of
Richmond or Louisville. In his report for 1908,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12426src" href="#xd27e12426" name="xd27e12426src">17</a>
Governor-General Smith himself makes this perfectly clear, where he
describes the Samar Pulajan, or mountaineer, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The Pulajan is not a robber or a thief by
nature&mdash;quite the contrary. He is hard working, industrious, and
even frugal. He had his little <i>late</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12437src" href="#xd27e12437" name="xd27e12437src">18</a> of hemp
on the side of the mountain, and breaking out his <i>picul</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e12445src" href="#xd27e12445" name=
"xd27e12445src">19</a> of hemp, he carried it hank by hank for miles
and miles over almost impassable mountain trails to the nearest town or
barrio. There he offered it for sale, and if he refused the price
tendered, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb545" href="#pb545" name=
"pb545">545</a>]</span>which was generally not more than half the
value, he soon found himself arrested on a trumped-up charge, and
unless he compromised by parting with his hemp he found himself, after
paying his fine and lawyer&rsquo;s fees, without either hemp or

<p>The non-Christian tribes, on the other hand, never have anything to
do with the civilized people. The Act of Congress of 1902, therefore,
had no sort of reference to the simple, ignorant, and ordinarily docile
mountain folk who tilled the soil, revered the priests, paid their
<i>cedula</i> or head tax like all the rest of the population of the
Islands, and carried their agricultural products from season to season,
their hemp and the like, to the coast towns to market. In other words,
inclusion of the Samar &ldquo;Pulajans,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Red
Breeches&rdquo; brigade, and the Leyte bandits, in the peace
certificate of 1907, as &ldquo;non-Christian tribes&rdquo; was an
afterthought, having no foundation either in logic or fact. It was a
part of Benevolent Assimilation. This is clearly apparent from
President Roosevelt&rsquo;s message to Congress of December,
1905.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12462src" href="#xd27e12462" name=
"xd27e12462src">20</a> You do not find any buncombe about
&ldquo;non-Christian tribes&rdquo; in that message. In there reviewing
the Samar and other insurrections of 1905 in the Philippines, you find
him dealing with the real root of the evil with perfect honesty, though
adopting the view that <i>the Filipino people</i> were to blame
therefor, because <i>we</i> had placed too much power in the hands of
an ignorant electorate, which had elected rascally officials.
&ldquo;Cavite and Samar,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;are instances of
reposing too much confidence in the self-governing power of a
people.&rdquo; If we had let the Filipinos go ahead with their little
republic in 1898, instead of destroying it as we did, they knew and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb546" href="#pb546" name=
"pb546">546</a>]</span>would have utilized the true elements of
strength they had, viz., a very considerable body of educated,
patriotic men having the loyal confidence of the masses of the people.
But we proceeded to ram down their throats a preconceived theory that
<i>the only</i> road to self-government was for an alien people to step
in and make the ignorant masses the <i>sine qua non</i>. Yet if there
was one point on which Mr. McKinley had laid more stress than on any
other, in his original instructions of April 7, 1900, to the Taft
Commission, that point was the one consecrated in the following
language of those instructions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">In all the forms of government and administrative
provisions which they are authorized to prescribe, the commission
should bear in mind that the government which they are establishing is
designed <i>not for *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* the expression of our theoretical
views</i>, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course the ignorant electorate we perpetrated on Samar as an
&ldquo;expression of our theoretical views&rdquo; proved that we had
&ldquo;gone too fast&rdquo; in conferring self-government, or, to quote
Mr. Roosevelt, had been &ldquo;reposing too much confidence in the
self-governing power of a people,&rdquo; if to begin with the rankest
material for constructing a government that there was at hand was to
offer a fair test of capacity for self-government. But President
Roosevelt&rsquo;s message, above quoted, shows you that the
&ldquo;ignorant electorate&rdquo; was merely an ignorant electorate,
and not a non-Christian tribe, as the Philippine Commission later had
the temerity to certify they were. Now the plain, unvarnished,
benevolent truth is just this: The Commission knew that nobody in the
United States, whether they were <i>for</i> retaining the Islands or
<i>against</i> retaining them, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb547"
href="#pb547" name="pb547">547</a>]</span>had any desire to postpone
granting a legislature to the Philippine people. So in their
certificate they simply included everybody who had given trouble in
Samar and Leyte as &ldquo;non-Christian tribes.&rdquo; The only
justification for this was that they had in fact acted in a most
un-Christianlike manner,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, for people who devotedly
murmur prayers to patron saints in good standing in the church
calendar. In making their certificate, the Commission simply ignored
the various uprisings of the preceding two years. They simply said,
generously, &ldquo;Oh, forget it.&rdquo; They knew nobody in the United
States begrudged the Filipinos their conditionally promised
legislature, or cared to postpone it. The leading Filipinos begged the
authorities to &ldquo;forget&rdquo; the various disturbances that had
occurred since the publication of the census, and there was a very
general desire in the Islands to let bygones be bygones, wipe the
slate, and begin again. Any other attitude would have meant that the
legislature would have to be postponed. Then the opposition in the
United States would want to know why, and by 1908 Philippine
independence might become an issue again. In the eyes of the
Commission, the end, being benevolent, justified stretching the
language of the Act of 1902 as if it had been the blessed veil of
charity itself&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the end justified the means. In fact
it <i>did</i>&mdash;almost&mdash;justify the means. But not quite. The
moral quality of the Great Certificate of 1907 was not as reprehensible
as General Anderson&rsquo;s dealings with Aguinaldo, already described,
which, like the certificate, were a necessary part of the benevolent
hypocrisy of Benevolent Assimilation of an unconsenting people. Yet
General Anderson is an honorable man. It was not as bad as General
Greene&rsquo;s juggling Aguinaldo out of his trenches before Manila in
a friendly way, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb548" href="#pb548"
name="pb548">548</a>]</span>failing to give him a receipt for said
trenches, as he had promised to do, because such a receipt would show
co-operation and &ldquo;might look too much like an alliance.&rdquo;
This also was done on the idea that the end justified the means. Yet
General Greene is an honorable man. The signers of the great peace
certificate of 1907 are all honorable men. But they signed that
certificate, just the same. &ldquo;Judge not that ye be not
judged.&rdquo; All I have to say is, I would not have signed that
certificate. I would have said: &ldquo;No, gentlemen, the end does
<i>not</i> justify the means. The Philippine Assembly must be
postponed, if we are going to deal frankly with Congress and the folks
at home. The conditions Congress made precedent to the grant of an
assembly have <i>not</i> been met, and we each and all of us know it.
We owe more to our own country and to truth than we do to the
Filipinos. The Act of Congress of 1902 did not vest in the Philippine
Commission authority to pardon disturbances of public order. It imposed
upon the Commission an implied duty to report such disturbances, fully
and frankly. It is not true that there has been a continuing state of
general and complete peace in these Islands for the last two years, and
I for one will not certify that there has been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The truth is, the attitude of the signers of the certificate was
like that of Uncle Remus, when interrupted by the little boy in one of
his stories. When Uncle Remus gets to the point in the rabbit story
where the rabbit thrillingly escapes from the jaws of death,
<i>i.e.</i>, from the jaws of the dogs, by climbing a tree, the rapt
listener interrupts: &ldquo;Why, Uncle Remus, a rabbit can&rsquo;t
climb a tree.&rdquo; To which Uncle Remus replies, with a reassuring
wave of the hand, &ldquo;Oh, but Honey, <i>dis</i> rabbit dess
<i>&rsquo;bleeged</i> ter climb <i>dis</i> tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Should any of my good friends still in the Philippines <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb549" href="#pb549" name="pb549">549</a>]</span>feel
disposed to censure such levity as the above, I can only say, as
Kipling writes from England to his Anglo-Indian friends in a foreword
to one of his books:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">I have told these tales of our life</p>
<p class="line xd27e12539">For a sheltered people&rsquo;s mirth,</p>
<p class="line">In jesting guise,&mdash;but ye are wise,</p>
<p class="line xd27e12539">And ye know what the jest is worth.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Moreover, my authority to speak frankly about these
matters is also aptly stated by the same great poet thus:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">I have eaten your bread and salt,</p>
<p class="line xd27e12539">I have drunk your water and wine,</p>
<p class="line">The deaths ye died I have watched beside</p>
<p class="line xd27e12539">And the lives that ye led were mine.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Was there aught that I did not share</p>
<p class="line xd27e12539">In vigil or toil or ease,</p>
<p class="line">One joy or woe that I did not know,</p>
<p class="line xd27e12539">Dear friends across the seas?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">The above reflections are not placed before the reader
to show him what a pity it is that the writer was not a member of the
Philippine Commission at the time of their certificate of 1907, or to
show what a fine thing for our common country it would be if he were
made a member of that Commission now. He is, personally, as
disinterested as if Manila were in the moon, for he cannot live in the
tropics any more. The effect of a year or so of residence there upon
white men invalided home for tropical dysentery and then returning to
the Islands is like the effect of water upon a starched shirt. However,
it is believed that the facts of official record collected in this
chapter up to this point are a <i>demonstration</i> of this
proposition, to wit: <i>What the Philippine Government needs more than
anything else is that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb550" href=
"#pb550" name="pb550">550</a>]</span>the minority party in the United
States should be represented on the Commission</i>. By this I do not
mean representation by what are called, under Republican
Administrations, &ldquo;White House&rdquo; Democrats, nor what under a
Democratic Administration, if one should ever occur, would probably be
called &ldquo;Copperhead Republicans.&rdquo; I mean the genuine
article. A Democrat who has cast his fortunes with the Philippines is
no longer a Democrat relatively to the Philippines, because the
Democratic party wants to get rid of the Philippines and the Democrat
in the Philippines of course does not. How absurd it is to talk about
former Governors Wright and Smith, as &ldquo;life-long
Democrats,&rdquo; by way of preliminary to using their opinions as
&ldquo;admissions.&rdquo; In the law of evidence, an
&ldquo;admission&rdquo; is a statement made against the interest of the
party making it.</p>
<p>The first election for representatives in the Philippine Assembly
was held on July 30, 1907, and on October 16th thereafter the Assembly
was formally opened by Secretary of War, William H. Taft. The various
&ldquo;whereases&rdquo; hereinabove reviewed, importing complete
acquiescence in American rule since President Roosevelt&rsquo;s
Proclamation of July 4, 1902, were first duly read, and then the
Assembly was opened. Of course, no man could have been elected to the
Assembly without at least pretending to be in favor of independence,
and all but a corporal&rsquo;s guard of them were outspoken in favor of
the proposition. As the present Governor-General Mr. Forbes, said,
while Vice-Governor, in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> for February,
1909:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">To deny the capacity of one&rsquo;s country for
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* self-government is essentially unpopular.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When he visited the Philippines to open their Assembly in 1907, Mr.
Taft had said nothing definite and final <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb551" href="#pb551" name="pb551">551</a>]</span>on the question of
promising <span class="corr" id="xd27e12590" title=
"Source: in dependence">independence</span> since his departure from
the Islands in 1903. His then benevolent unwillingness to tell them
frankly he did not think they had sense enough to run a government of
their own, and that they were unfit for self-government, has already
been reviewed. For two years after 1903 Governor Wright had made them
pine for the return of Mr. Taft. They longed to hear again some of the
siren notes of the celebrated speech &ldquo;the Philippines for the
Filipinos.&rdquo; They had gotten very excited and very happy over that
speech. Of course they would not have gotten very excited over
independence supposed to be coming long after they should be dead and
buried. During the two dark frank years of Governor Wright&rsquo;s
<i>r&eacute;gime</i>, they had frequently been told that they were not
fit for independence. So that when Secretary of War Taft had visited
the Islands in 1905 they all had been on the <i>qui vive</i> for more
statements vaguely implying an independence they might hope to live to
see. During the visit of 1905 the time of the visiting Congressional
party was consumed principally with tariff hearings, and comparatively
little was said on the subject uppermost in the minds of all Filipinos.
It is true that Mr. Taft said then <i>he</i> was of the opinion that it
would take a generation or longer to get the country ready for
self-government, but he said it in a tactful, kindly way, and did not
forever crush their hopes. So when he went out to the Islands to open
the assembly in 1907, the attitude of the whole people in expectation
of some definite utterances on the question of a definite
<i>promise</i> of independence at <i>some</i> future time, was just the
attitude of an audience in a theatre as to which one affirms &ldquo;you
could hear a pin fall.&rdquo; In this regard Mr. Taft&rsquo;s
utterances were as follows<a class="noteref" id="xd27e12609src" href=
"#xd27e12609" name="xd27e12609src">21</a>: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb552" href="#pb552" name="pb552">552</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I am aware that in view of the issues discussed at the
election of this assembly I am expected to say something regarding the
policy of the United States toward these islands. I cannot speak with
the authority of one who may control that policy. The Philippine
Islands are territory belonging to the United States, and by the
Constitution, the branch of that government vested with the power and
charged with the duty of making rules and regulations for their
government is Congress. The policy to be pursued with respect to them
is therefore ultimately for Congress to determine. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I
have no authority to speak for Congress in respect to the ultimate
disposition of the Islands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that there was some talk about &ldquo;mutually beneficial
trade relations&rdquo; and &ldquo;improvement of the people both
industrially and in self-governing capacity.&rdquo; But with regard to
the &ldquo;process of political preparation of the Filipino
people&rdquo; for self-government the Secretary said that was a
question no one could certainly answer; and so far as he was concerned
he thought it would take &ldquo;considerable longer than a
generation.&rdquo; Somewhere in the early Philippine State papers there
is a quotation used by Mr. Taft from Shakespeare about &ldquo;Keeping
the word of promise to the ear and breaking it to the hope.&rdquo; The
Filipinos have eagerly read for the last twelve years every utterance
of Mr. Taft&rsquo;s that they could get hold of. If any of those
embryonic statesmen of the first Philippine Assembly, familiar with the
various Taft utterances, had looked up the context of the Shakespearian
quotation above alluded to, he would have found it to be as
follows:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">And be these juggling fiends no more
believ&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="line">That palter with us in a double sense:</p>
<p class="line">That keep the word of promise to our ear</p>
<p class="line">And break it to our hope.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12631src" href="#xd27e12631" name="xd27e12631src">22</a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb553" href="#pb553" name=
"pb553">553</a>]</span></p>
<p>Since the announcement by Secretary of War Taft at the opening of
the Philippine Assembly in October, 1907, of the policy of indefinite
retention of the Islands with undeclared intention, the Filipinos have
of course clearly understood that if they were ever to have
independence they must look to Congress for it. But they know Congress
is not interested in them and that they have no influence with it, and
that the Hemp Trust, the Tobacco Trust, and the Sugar Trust, have. So
that since 1907, both the American authorities in the Philippines and
the Filipinos have settled down, the former suffused with
benevolence&mdash;hardened however by paternalistic firmness, the
latter stoically, to the programme of indefinite retention with
undeclared intention. No conceivable programme could be devised more
ingeniously calculated to engender race hatred. The Filipino newspapers
call the present policy one of &ldquo;permanent administration for
inferior and incapable races.&rdquo; The Act of Congress of July 1,
1902, known as the Philippine Government Act, which is the
&ldquo;Constitution,&rdquo; so to speak, we have given the Filipinos,
accords &ldquo;liberty of the press&rdquo; in the exact language of our
own Constitution. The native press does not fail to use this liberty to
the limit. Naturally the American press does not remain silent. So here
are a pair of bellows ever fanning the charcoals of discontent. And the
masses of the Filipino people read the Filipino papers. If they cannot
read, their children can. In one of the reports of one of the American
constabulary officials in the Philippines, there is an account of the
influence of the native press too graphic to be otherwise than
accurate. He says one can often see, in the country districts, a group
of natives gathered about some village Hampden, listening to his
reading the latest diatribe against the American Occupation. Never was
there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb554" href="#pb554" name=
"pb554">554</a>]</span>such folly in the annals of statesmanship. In
their native papers, the race situation of course comes in for much
comment. Now the most notorious and inflexible fact of that race
situation is that the colonial Anglo-Saxon does not intermarry with
&ldquo;the yellow and brown&rdquo; subject people, as the Latin
colonizing races do. It would be an over-statement of the case to say
that the Filipinos to-day had rather have the Spaniards back as their
overlords instead of us. In 1898, they &ldquo;tasted the sweets of
liberty,&rdquo; to use an expression of one of their leaders, and I am
perfectly sure that to-day the desire of all those people for a
government of their own is so genuine and universal as that it amounts
to a very hopeful positive factor in the equation of their capacity for
self-government. But there is no doubt that many of the Filipinos after
all have a very warm place in their hearts for the Spanish people. How
could it be otherwise when so many of the Filipinos are sons and
grandsons of Spaniards? Much of like and dislike in life&rsquo;s
journey is determined pre-natally. On the other hand, the American
women in the Philippines maintain an attitude toward the natives quite
like that of their British sisters in Hong Kong toward the Chinese, and
in Calcutta toward the natives there. The social status of an American
woman who marries a native,&mdash;I myself have never heard of but one
case&mdash;is like that of a Pacific coast girl who marries a Jap. This
is merely the instinct of self-defence with which Nature provides the
weaker sex, just as she provides the porcupine with quills. But look at
the other side of the picture. When an American man marries a native
woman, he thereafter finds himself more in touch with his native
&ldquo;in-laws&rdquo; it is true, but correspondingly, and ever
increasingly, out of touch with his former associations. This is not as
it should be. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb555" href="#pb555" name=
"pb555">555</a>]</span>But it is a most unpleasant and inexorable fact
of the present situation. In an address delivered at the Quill Club in
Manila on January 25, 1909, Governor Smith, after reciting the various
beneficent designs contemplated by the government and the various
public works consummated (at the expense of the people of the Islands)
deplored, in spite of it all, what he termed &ldquo;the growing gulf
between the races.&rdquo; Said he:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">An era of ill feeling has started between Americans
and Filipinos, and, I hesitate to say it, race hatred.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Cherchez la femme!</i> You find her, on the one hand, in the
American woman whose attitude has been indicated, and you find her, on
the other, in the refined and virtuous native woman, who finds her
American husband&rsquo;s relations to his compatriots
altered&mdash;queered&mdash;since his marriage to her, no matter how
faithful a wife and mother she may be. This is the unspeakably cruel
situation we have forced upon the Filipino people&mdash;whom I really
learned to respect, and became much attached to, before I left the
Islands&mdash;<i>and President Taft knows it as well as I do</i>. Yet
he does not take the American people into his confidence. He simply
worries along with the situation, wishing it would get better, but
knowing it will get worse. That this situation is a permanent one is
clearly shown by all the previous teachings of racial history. In his
<i>Winning of the West</i>, written in 1889, speaking of the French
settlers in the Ohio valley before 1776, and the cordial social
relations of the dominant race with the natives&mdash;relations which
have always obtained with all Latin races under like
circumstances&mdash;Mr. Roosevelt says (vol. i., page 41): <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb556" href="#pb556" name="pb556">556</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">They were not trammelled by the queer pride which
makes a man of English stock unwilling to make a red-skinned woman his
wife, though anxious enough to make her his concubine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Men of English stock have changed but little in the matter of race
instinct since 1776. If we had a definite policy, declared by Congress,
promising independence, the American attitude in the Philippines toward
the Filipinos would at once change, from the present impossible one, to
our ordinary natural attitude of courtesy toward all foreigners,
regardless of their color.</p>
<p>On May 7, 1909, the Honorable James F. Smith took his departure from
the Philippine Islands forever and turned over the duties of his office
to the Honorable W. Cameron Forbes, as Acting President of the
Commission and Governor-General. As in the case of Governors Wright and
Ide, so in that of Governor Smith, no reason is apparent why the
Washington Government should have been willing to dispense with the
services of the incumbent. This was peculiarly true in the case of
General Smith. He was but fifty years of age when he left the Islands
in 1909. He has rendered more different kinds of distinguished public
service than any American who has ever been in the Philippine Islands
from the time Dewey&rsquo;s guns first thundered out over Manila Bay
down to this good hour. Going out with the first expedition in 1898 as
Colonel of the 1st California Regiment, he distinguished himself on
more than one battlefield in the early fighting and in recognition
thereof was made a brigadier-general. Subsequent to this he became
Military Governor of the island of Negros, that one of the six
principal Visayan Islands which gave less trouble during the
insurrection and after than any other&mdash;a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb557" href="#pb557" name=
"pb557">557</a>]</span>circumstance doubtless not wholly unrelated to
General Smith&rsquo;s wise and tactful administration there. Later on
during the military <i>r&eacute;gime</i> he became Collector of Customs
of the archipelago. The revenues from customs are the principal source
of revenue of the Philippine Government and the sums of money handled
are enormous. The customs service, moreover, in most countries, and
especially in the Philippines, is more subject to the creeping in of
graft than any other. General Smith&rsquo;s administration of this post
was in keeping with everything else he did in the Islands. When the
civil government was founded by Judge Taft in 1901, he was appointed
one of the Justices of the Supreme Court and filled the duties of that
office most creditably. Thence he was promoted to the Philippine
Commission, which is, virtually, the cabinet of the Governor-General.
Still later he became Vice-Governor, and finally Governor, serving as
such from September, 1906, to May, 1909. Any other government on earth
that has over-seas colonies and recognizes the supreme importance of a
maximum of continuity of policy, would have kept Governor Smith as long
as it could have possibly induced him to stay, just as the British kept
Lord Cromer in Egypt. Governor Smith was succeeded by a young man from
Boston, who had come out to the Islands four years before, and who,
prior to that time, had never had any public service in the United
States of any kind, had never been in the Philippine Islands, and
probably had never seen a Filipino until he landed at Manila.</p>
<p>General Smith is now (1912) one of the Judges of the Court of
Customs Appeals at Washington. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb558"

<p>No one of these distinguished gentlemen has ever had any authority
to tell the Filipinos what we expect ultimately to do with them. They
have not known themselves. Is not this distinctly unfair both to
governors and governed? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb559" href=
"#pb559" name="pb559">559</a>]</span></p>
<p>Before Governor Forbes went to the Philippines he had been a largely
successful business man. He is a man of the very highest personal
character, and an indefatigable worker. He has done as well as the
conditions of the problem permit. But he is always between Scylla and
Charybdis. American capital in or contemplating investment in the
Islands is continually pressing to be permitted to go ahead and develop
the resources of the Islands. To keep the Islands from being exploited
Congress early limited grants of land to a maximum too small to attract
capital. So those who desire to build up the country, knowing they
cannot get the law changed, are forever seeking to invent ways to get
around the law. And, being firm in the orthodox Administration belief
that discussion of ultimate independence is purely academic,
<i>i.e.</i>, a matter of no concern to anybody now living, Governor
Forbes is of course in sympathy with Americans who wish to develop the
resources of the Islands. On the other hand, he knows that such a
course will daily and hourly make ultimate independence more certain
never to come. So do the Filipinos know this. Therefore they clamor
ever louder and louder against all American attempts to repeal the
anti-exploiting Acts of Congress by &ldquo;liberal&rdquo;
interpretation. Many an American just here is sure to ask himself,
&ldquo;Why all this &lsquo;clamor&rsquo;? Do we not give them good
government? What just ground have they for complaint?&rdquo; Yes, we do
give them very good government, so far as the Manila end of the
business is concerned, except that it is a far more expensive
government than any people on the earth would be willing to impose on
themselves. But their main staples are hemp, sugar, and tobacco, and we
raise the last two in this country. Their sugar and tobacco were
allowed free entry into the United <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb560"
href="#pb560" name="pb560">560</a>]</span>States by the Paine Law of
1909 up to amounts limited in the law, but the Philippine people know
very well that American sugar and tobacco interests will either dwarf
the growth of their sugar and tobacco industries by refusing to allow
the limit raised&mdash;the limit of amounts admitted free of
duty&mdash;or else that our Sugar Trust and our Tobacco Trust will
simply ultimately eliminate them by absorption, just as the Standard
Oil Company used to do with small competitors. In this sort of prospect
certainly even the dullest intellect must recognize just ground for
fearing&mdash;nay for <i>plainly foreseeing</i>&mdash;practical
industrial slavery through control by foreign<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12786src" href="#xd27e12786" name="xd27e12786src">2</a>
corporations of economic conditions. So much for the two staples in
which the Philippines may some day become competitors of ours. It took
Mr. Taft nine years to persuade American sugar and tobacco that they
would not be in any immediate danger by letting in a little Philippine
sugar and tobacco free of duty. Then they consented. Not until then did
they promise not to shout &ldquo;Down with cheap Asiatic labor. We will
not consent to compete with it.&rdquo; Their mental reservation was, of
course, and is, &ldquo;if the Philippine sugar and tobacco industries
get too prosperous, we will either buy them, or cripple them by
defeating their next attempt to get legislation increasing the amounts
of Philippine sugar and tobacco admitted into the United States free of
duty.&rdquo; And the Filipinos <i>know</i> that this is the fate that
awaits two out of the three main sources of the wealth of their
country. Their third source of wealth, their main staple, is the
world-famous Manila hemp. This represents more than half the value of
their total annual exports. And as to it, &ldquo;practical industrial
slavery through control by foreign corporations of economic
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb561" href="#pb561" name=
"pb561">561</a>]</span>conditions&rdquo; is to-day not a <i>fear</i>,
but a <i>fact</i>. The International Harvester Company has its agents
at Manila. The said company or allied interests, or both, are large
importers of Manila hemp. The reports of all the governors-general of
the Philippines who have preceded Governor Forbes tell, year after
year, of the millions &ldquo;handed over&rdquo; to American hemp
importers through &ldquo;the hemp joker&rdquo; of the Act of Congress
of 1902, hereinafter explained, in the chapter on Congressional
Legislation (<a href="#ch26">Chapter XXVI</a>.). Why did these
complaints&mdash;made with annual regularity up to Governor
Forbes&rsquo;s accession&mdash;cease thereafter? You will find these
complaints of his predecessors <i>transcribed</i> in the chapter
mentioned, because if I had re-stated them you might suspect
exaggeration. The &ldquo;rake-off&rdquo; of the American importers of
Manila hemp for 1910 was nearly $750,000, as fully explained in
<a href="#ch26">Chapter XXVI</a>.</p>
<p>Governor Forbes will be in this country when this book is issued. I
think he owes it to the American people to explain why he does not
continue the efforts of his predecessors to halt the depredations of
the Hemp Trust. Why does he content himself in his last annual report
with a mild allusion to the fact that the condition of the hemp
industry is &ldquo;not satisfactory&rdquo;? I have said that Governor
Forbes is a man of high character, and take pleasure in repeating that
statement in this connection. The truth is we are running a political
kindergarten for adults in the Philippines, and those responsible for
the original blunder of taking them, and all their political heirs and
assigns since, have sought to evade admitting and setting to work to
rectify the blunder. Unmasked, this is what the policy of Benevolent
Assimilation now is. They allege an end, and so justify all the ways
and means. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb562" href="#pb562" name=
"pb562">562</a>]</span>Benevolent Assimilation needs the support of the
International Harvester Company and of all other Big Business
interested directly or indirectly in Manila hemp. The end justifies the
means. Hence the silence. Philippine gubernatorial reticence is always
most reticent about that particular subject on which at the time the
American people are most peculiarly entitled to information. As long as
public order was the most pressing question, Philippine gubernatorial
reticence selected that branch of our colonial problem either for
especial silence or for superlatively casual allusion, as we have
already seen. So now with the economic distresses. Frankness would
obviously furnish too much good argument for winding up this Oriental
receivership of ours. The Philippine Government will never tell its
main current troubles until after they are over. But as the present
trouble&mdash;the economic depredations of powerful special
interests&mdash;must necessarily be fruitful of discontent which will
crop out some day to remind us that as we sow so shall we reap, any one
who helps expose the root of the trouble is doing a public service. No
Congressman who in silence would permit Big Business to prey upon his
constituents as Governor Forbes has, could long remain in office.
Taxation without representation may amount to depredation, and yet
never be corrected, when the powers that prey have the ear of the
court, and the victims cannot get the ear of the American people. So
the Hemp Trust continues to rob the Filipinos under the forms of law,
and the Mohonk Conference continues to kiss Benevolent Assimilation on
both cheeks. And Dr. Lyman Abbott periodically says Amen. I am not
speaking disrespectfully of Dr. Abbott. I am deploring the lack of
information of our people at home as to conditions in the Philippines.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb563" href="#pb563" name=
"pb563">563</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is a relief to turn from such matters to some of the real
substantial good we have done out there to which Governor Forbes has
heretofore publicly pointed with just pride. In an article in the
<i>Atlantic Monthly</i> for February, 1909, Governor Forbes (then
Vice-Governor) said, among other things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We have completed the separation of Church and State,
buying out from the religious orders their large agricultural
properties, which are now administered by the government for the
benefit of the tenants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement I cannot too cordially endorse. It would be grossly
unfair not to accord full measure of acclaim to Governor Taft for the
way he worked out the problem of the Friar Lands. He has been attacked
in some quarters in this regard, and most unjustly. Not being a
Catholic, and all my people being Protestants, I have no fear of being
suspected of special pleading in the matter. The working out of the
Friar Land problem by Governor Taft in the Philippines was a splendid
piece of constructive statesmanship. He was at his greatest and best in
that very transaction. The Treaty of Paris had guaranteed that all
vested rights should be respected, including those of ecclesiastical
bodies. The friars had long owned the lands in question. There can be
no particle of doubt on this point. The tenants on the land had all
long ago attorned to them, father and son, from time out of mind,
paying rent regularly. But by claiming jurisdiction over their
tenants&rsquo; souls also, and getting that jurisdiction effectively
recognized, the thrifty friars used to raise the rent regularly,
quieting incipient protest with threats of eternal punishment, or
protracted stay in purgatory. The advent of our government let loose a
revolt against the authority of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb564" href="#pb564" name="pb564">564</a>]</span>friars generally,
and, their spiritual hold once loosened, this led the tenants to
dispute the land titles of their spiritual shepherds, who were also
their temporal landlords. Of course the titles had all been long
recorded, and looked after by the best legal talent the country
afforded. As long as you control the future of your tenant&rsquo;s
soul, you can make him pay his last copeck for rent. But as soon as
that control is lost, the man on whom the governing of the country
thereafter devolves has a certain prospect of a great agrarian
revolution on his hands, having in it many elements of substantial
righteousness. Governor Taft&rsquo;s capacious mind, prompted by his
strongest instinct, love of justice, conceived the idea of having the
Philippine Government raise the money to buy the Friar Lands, by
issuing bonds, and then buying the Friars out and re-selling the land
to the tenants on long time, on the instalment plan, the instalments to
be so graduated as to be equal to a moderate rental. Each tenant stayed
right where he had been all the time, in possession of the tract he had
always tilled, he and his father before him. To arrange all this it
took an Act of Congress authorizing the bond issue, and a visit to Rome
to arrange the bargain with the Pope. Some say His Holiness drove a
hard bargain with Governor Taft, or to put it another way, that
Governor Taft paid the Church people too much for the land. He did not.
He may not have counted pennies with them, but the lands were worth
what he paid for them. And the purchase protected the faith and honor
of our government, as pledged by the Treaty of Paris, and at the same
time prevented an agrarian revolution&mdash;which would have had a lot
of elemental justice on its side.</p>
<p>Another of the good works we have done in the Philippines, to which
Governor Forbes points in his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb565"
href="#pb565" name="pb565">565</a>]</span>magazine article above
mentioned, is thus noted by him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We have put the finances on a sound and sensible
basis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this also I say Amen. The Forbes article then goes on to say that
the government of the Islands is self-supporting. This is true, except
the $14,000,000 a year it costs us to keep out there a garrison of
12,000 American troops (supplemented by certain native scouts&mdash;see
chapter on &ldquo;Cost of the Philippines,&rdquo; hereafter). This
garrison is conceded to be a mere handful, sufficient merely, and
intended merely&mdash;as a witty English woman has put it in a book on
the Philippines&mdash;&ldquo;to knock the Filipino on the head in case
he wants his liberty before the Americans think he is fit for
it.&rdquo; In other words, we only attempt to keep force enough there
to quell any outbreak that might occur. So far as possible invasion by
any foreign power is concerned, our $14,000,000 per annum is an
absolutely dead loss. Brigadier-General Clarence Edwards, U. S. A.,
commanding the Bureau of Insular Affairs, said recently<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e12841src" href="#xd27e12841" name=
"xd27e12841src">3</a> before the Finance Committee of the Senate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I would never think of the Philippines as a military
problem for defence. If any nation wants them, it is merely a
declaration of war.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a shameful admission for a great nation to subscribe to,
relatively to people it pretends to be protecting! The programme of the
War Department is to abandon the Islands to their fate, for the time
being at least, in our next war, letting them remain a football until
the end of such war, when, as an independent republic they could, and
would, rally as one man to the defence of their country against
invasion, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb566" href="#pb566" name=
"pb566">566</a>]</span>would, with a little help from us, make life
unbearable for an invading force. As things stand, we are just as
impotent as Spain was out there in 1898, and it is utter folly to
forget what happened then.</p>
<p>But to return to Governor Forbes&rsquo;s article and to a pleasanter
feature of the situation. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We have established schools throughout the
archipelago, teaching upward of half a million children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also is true, and greatly to our credit. But as the American
hemp trust mulcts the Philippine hemp output about a half million
dollars a year (as above suggested, and later, in another chapter, more
fully explained), it follows that each Filipino child pays the hemp
trust a dollar a year for the privilege of going to school.</p>
<p>And now let us consider the most supremely important part of
Governor Forbes&rsquo;s magazine article above quoted. The burden of
the song of the adverse minority report on the pending Jones bill
(looking to Philippine independence in 1921)<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e12866src" href="#xd27e12866" name="xd27e12866src">4</a> is that
because there are certain &ldquo;wild tribes&rdquo; scattered
throughout the archipelago, in the mountain fastnesses, therefore we
should cling to the present policy of indefinite retention with
undeclared intention until the wild tribes get civilized. Governor
Forbes&rsquo;s article is an absolute, complete, and final answer to
the misinformed nonsense of the minority report aforesaid. He says,
apropos of public order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">It is now safe to travel everywhere throughout the
Islands without carrying a weapon, excepting only in some of the remote
parts of the mountains, where lurk bands of wild tribes who might
possibly mistake the object of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb567"
href="#pb567" name="pb567">567</a>]</span>visit, and in the southern
part of the great island of Mindanao which is inhabited by intractable
Moros.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The foregoing unmasks, in all its contemptible falsehood, the
pretence that the presence of a few wild tribes in the Philippines is a
reason for withholding independence from 7,000,000 of Christian people
in order that a greedy little set of American importers of Manila hemp
may fatten thereon. True, hemp is not edible, but it is convertible
into edibles&mdash;and also into campaign funds. That the existence of
these wild tribes&mdash;the dog-eating Igorrotes and other savages you
saw exhibited at the St. Louis Exposition of
1903&ndash;4&mdash;constitute infinitely less reason for withholding
independence from the Filipinos than the American Indian constituted in
1776 for withholding independence from us, will be sufficiently
apparent from a glance at the following table, taken from the

million people. Half of these are civilized Christians, and the other
half are the wild, crudely Mohammedan Moro tribes. Above Mindanao on
the above list, you behold what practically <i>is</i> the Philippine
archipelago (except Mindanao), viz., Luzon and the six main Visayan
Islands. If you will turn back to pages 225 <i>et seq.</i>, especially
to page 228, where the student of world politics was furnished with all
he needs or will ever care to know about the geography of the
Philippine Islands, you will there find all the rocks sticking out of
the water and all the little daubs you see on the map eliminated from
the equation as wholly unessential to a clear understanding of the
problem of governing the Islands. That process of elimination left us
Luzon and the six main Visayan Islands above, as constituting, for all
practical governmental purposes all the Philippine archipelago except
the Moro country, Mindanao (<i>i.e.</i>, parts of it), and its adjacent
islets; Luzon and the Visayan Islands contain nearly 7,000,000 of
people, and of these the wild tribes, as you can see by a glance at the
above table, constitute less than 300,000, sprinkled in the pockets of
their various mountain regions. Nearly all these 300,000 are quite
tame, peaceable, and tractable, except, as Governor Forbes suggests,
they &ldquo;might possibly mistake the object of a visit.&rdquo; The
half million &ldquo;intractable Moros&rdquo; of Mindanao, plus those in
the adjacent islets, make up another 300,000. These last, it is true,
will need policing for some time to come, but whether we do that
policing by retaining Mindanao, or whether we let the Filipinos do it,
is a detail that has no standing in court as a reason for continuing to
deny independence to the 7,000,000 of people of Luzon and the Visayan
Islands because they have some 300,000 backward people in the backwoods
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb569" href="#pb569" name=
"pb569">569</a>]</span>their mountains. Yet see how the ingenuity of
inspired ignorance states the case, by adding the 300,000 tame tribes
of Luzon and the Visayas to the 300,000 fierce Moro savages away down
in Mindanao, near Borneo, so as to get 600,000 &ldquo;wild&rdquo;
people, and then alluding to the fact that so far only 200,000
Filipinos are qualified to vote. Says the report of the minority of the
Committee on Insular Affairs on the pending Jones bill (proposing
independence in 1921):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The wild and uncivilized inhabitants of the islands
outnumber, 3 to 1, those who would be qualified to vote under the
pending bill [the Jones bill].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see the minority report is counting women and children, when it
talks about the wild tribes, but not when it talks about voters.
According to universally accepted general averages, among 7,500,000
people you should find 1,500,000 adult males. No one doubts that of
these, by 1921, 500,000 will have become qualified voters. No one can
deny that any such country having 500,000 qualified voters, the bulk of
whom are good farmers, and the cream of whom are high-minded educated
gentlemen, and all of whom are intensely patriotic, will be in good
shape for promotion to independence. What wearies me about this whole
matter is that the minority report above mentioned is permitted to get
off such &ldquo;rot,&rdquo; and the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Army
and Navy Journal</i>, and others, to applaud it, while the
Administration sits by, silent, and reaps the benefit of such stale,
though not intentional, falsehoods, without attempting to correct them,
so that our people may get at the real merits of the question. You see
this silence inures to the benefit of the interests that have cornered
the Manila hemp industry. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb570" href=

<p>In the campaign of 1912 for the Republican nomination for the
Presidency, there was much mutual recrimination between Colonel
Roosevelt and Mr. Taft about which of them had been kindest to the
International Harvester Company. It seems to me it is &ldquo;up
to&rdquo; Governor Forbes, who in the Philippines has served under the
present President and his predecessor also, to explain why he has
abandoned the fight, so long waged by previous governors-general, to
get what former Governor-General James F. Smith calls &ldquo;the [hemp]
joker&rdquo; of the Act of Congress of 1902 concerning the Philippines,
wiped from the statute books of this country. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the year 1911, the editor of one of the great
metropolitan papers told me that President Taft told him that the
Honorable Dean C. Worcester, the Secretary of the Interior of the
Philippine Government, was &ldquo;the most valuable man we have on the
Philippine Commission.&rdquo; Certainly, reproduction of such an
indorsement from so exalted a source shows a wish to be fair, in one
who considers Professor Worcester the direst calamity that has befallen
the Filipinos since the American occupation, neither war, pestilence,
famine, reconcentration, nor tariff-wrought poverty excepted. During
all my stay in the Philippines I never did have any official relations
of any sort with the Professor, and only met him, casually, once, in
1901. The personal impression left from the meeting was distinctly that
of an overbearing bully of the beggar-on-horseback type. Conscious of
liability to error, and preferring that the reader should judge for
himself, I give the main circumstances upon which this impression is
based. Soon after the central insular government was set up, in 1901,
Judge Taft and certain other members of the Philippine Commission, the
Professor among the number, came into my judicial district to organize
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb572" href="#pb572" name=
"pb572">572</a>]</span>provincial governments. Their coming to each
town where they stopped was telegraphed in advance, and before they
reached the town where I then was holding court each one of the
American colony of the town was designated by common consent to look
after a fraction of the Taft party during their stay. The Professor
fell to my lot. I always was unlucky. However, their stay was only a
few hours. While they were there, I had occasion to observe that the
Professor spoke Spanish quite well and so remarked to him. The
well-bred reply was: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find that I know a great many
things you might not think I knew.&rdquo; Whether this was merely
&ldquo;The insolence of office&rdquo; cropping out in a previously
obscure young man suddenly elevated to high station, or whether it was
an evidence of the Commissioner&rsquo;s idea of the relation of the
Executive Department of a government to its Judiciary, is a
question.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13031src" href="#xd27e13031" name=
"xd27e13031src">1</a> At all events I think the incident gives an
insight into the man not irrelevant to what is hereinafter submitted. I
have met a number of other Americans since who had received impressions
similar to my own. And the Professor&rsquo;s whole subsequent course in
the Islands corroborates those impressions. I have never talked to any
American in the Philippines who had a good word for him. Of course,
Power, like Property, will always have friends. So that even Professor
Worcester may have <i>some</i> friends, among his fellow-countrymen
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb573" href="#pb573" name=
"pb573">573</a>]</span>in those far-away Islands. But it has already
been made clear in a former chapter how entirely possible it is for a
man occupying high position in the government out there to be very
generally and cordially disliked by his own countrymen there and
actually not know it. Whether this is true of Professor Worcester, or
not, as a general proposition it is quite possible. One thing is
certain, namely, that he is very generally and very cordially detested
by the Filipinos. That this detestation is perfectly natural under the
circumstances, and entirely justifiable, and that it is a cruel
injustice to those people, as well as a monumental piece of folly, to
keep the Professor saddled upon them, it is now in order to show.</p>
<p>In <a href="#ch6">Chapter VI</a> (<i>ante</i>), we made the
acquaintance of two young naval officers. Paymaster W. B. Wilcox and
Naval Cadet L. R. Sargent, who, in the fall of 1898, while the fate of
the Philippines hung in the balance at Paris, and peace still reigned
in the Islands between us and the Filipinos, made a trip through the
interior of Luzon, covering some six hundred miles, and afterwards
furnished Admiral Dewey with a written report of their trip, which was
later published as a Senate document. Professor Worcester&rsquo;s
greatest value to President Taft, and also the thing out of which has
grown, most unfortunately, what seems to be a very cordial mutual
hatred between him and the Filipinos, is his activities in the matter
of discovering, getting acquainted with, classifying, tabulating,
enumerating, and otherwise preparing for salvation, the various
non-Christian tribes. These tribes have already been briefly dealt with
in <a href="#ch21">Chapter XXI</a>. (<i>ante</i>), apropos of that part
of the Great Peace Certificate of 1907 which related to the
&ldquo;Moros and other non-Christian tribes&rdquo;&mdash;uncivilized
tribes which, being as distinct from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb574" href="#pb574" name="pb574">574</a>]</span>great mass of the
Filipino people as islets from the sea, had had no more to do with the
insurrection against us, than the Pawnees, Apaches, and Sioux Indians
had to do with our Civil War of 1861&ndash;5. They were also dealt
with, somewhat, in the chapter preceding this. Long before Professor
Worcester was permanently inflicted upon the Filipino people, one of
the young naval officers above mentioned, Mr. Sargent, published an
article in the <i>Outlook</i> for September 2, 1899,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e13059src" href="#xd27e13059" name="xd27e13059src">2</a> based
on this trip through the interior of Luzon, made by authority of
Admiral Dewey the year before. In the course of his article Mr. Sargent
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Some years ago, at an exposition held at Barcelona,
Spain, a man and woman were exhibited as representative types of the
inhabitants of Luzon. The man wore a loin cloth, and the woman a scanty
skirt. It was evident that they belonged to the lowest plane of
savagery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>I think no deeper wound was ever inflicted upon the
pride of the real Filipino people than that caused by this exhibition,
the knowledge of which seems to have spread throughout the island.</i>
The man and woman, while actually natives of Luzon, were captives of a
wild tribe of Igorrotes of the hills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Professor Worcester was originally a professor of zo&ouml;logy, or
something of that sort, in a western university. In the early nineties
he had made a trip to the Philippines, confining himself then mostly to
creeping things and quadrupeds&mdash;lizards, alligators, pythons,
unusual wild beasts, and other forms of animal life of the kind much
coveted as specimens by museums and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb575" href="#pb575" name="pb575">575</a>]</span>universities. In
1899, just after the Spanish War, he got out a book on the Philippines,
and as an American who had been in the Philippines was then a <i lang=
"la">rara avis</i>, it came to pass that the reptile-finder ultimately
became a statesman. He was brought, possibly by conscious worth, to the
notice of President McKinley, accompanied the Schurman Commission to
the Islands, in 1899, and the Taft Commission in 1900, and finally
evolved into his present eminence as Secretary of the Interior and
official chief finder of non-Christian tribes for the Philippine
Government.</p>
<p>The best known of the wild tribes in the Philippines are the
Igorrotes, the dog-eating savages you saw at the St. Louis Exposition
in 1903&ndash;4, the same Mr. Sargent speaks of in his article in the
<i>Outlook</i>. Of course it was not a desire to misrepresent the
situation, but only the enthusiasm of a zo&ouml;logist,
anthropologically inclined, and accustomed to carry a kodak, which
started the Professor to photographing the dog-eating Igorrotes and
specimens of other non-Christian tribes soon after the Taft Commission
reached the Philippines. But you cannot get far in the earlier reports
of the Taft Commission, which was supposed to have been sent out to
report back on the capacity of the Filipinos for self-government,
without crossing the trail of the Professor&rsquo;s
kodak&mdash;pictures of naked Igorrotes and the like. This, however
innocent, must have been of distinct political value in 1900 and 1904
in causing the heart of the missionary vote in the United States to
bleed for those &ldquo;sixty different tribes having sixty different
languages&rdquo; of which Secretary Root&rsquo;s campaign speeches made
so much. It must also have greatly awakened the philanthropic interest
of exporters of cotton goods to learn of those poor &ldquo;savage
millions&rdquo; wearing only a loin cloth, when they could be wearing
yards of cotton <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb576" href="#pb576"
name="pb576">576</a>]</span>cloth. By the time the St. Louis Exposition
came off, in 1903&ndash;4, it was decided to have the various tribes
represented there. So specimens were sent of the Igorrote tribe, the
Tagalos, the Visayans, the Negrito tribe, and various other tribes. The
Tagalos, the Visayans, etc., being ordinary Filipinos, did not prove
money-makers. But it was great sport to watch the Igorrotes preparing
their morning dog. So it was the &ldquo;non-Christian tribes&rdquo;
that paid. It was they that were most advertised. It was the
recollection of them that lingered longest with the visitor to the
Exposition, and there was always in his mind thereafter an association
of ideas between the Igorrotes and Filipino capacity for
self-government generally. Many representative Filipinos visited the
St. Louis Exposition, saw all this, and came home and told about it.
One very excellent Filipino gentleman, a friend of mine, who was
Governor of Samar during my administration of the district which
included that island, sent me one day in October, 1904, a satirical
note, enclosing a pamphlet he had just received called <i>Catalogue of
Philippine Views at the St. Louis Exposition</i>. He knew I would
understand, so he said in the note, that the pamphlet was sent
&ldquo;in order that you may learn something of certain tribes <i>still
extant</i> in this country.&rdquo; Concerning all this, I can say of my
own knowledge exactly what Naval Cadet Sargent said concerning the
lesser like indignity of the <i>one</i> Igorrote couple exhibited at
Barcelona <i>while the Filipinos were asking representation in the
Spanish Cortes, viz.</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I think no deeper wound was ever inflicted upon the
pride of the real Filipino people than that caused by this exhibition,
the knowledge of which seems to have spread throughout the islands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb577" href="#pb577" name=
"pb577">577</a>]</span></p>
<p>You see our Census of 1903 gave the population of the Philippines at
about 7,600,000 of which 7,000,000 are put down as civilized
Christians; and of the remaining 600,000, about half are the savage, or
semi-civilized, crudely Mohammedan Moros, in Mindanao, and the adjacent
islets down near Borneo. The other 300,000 or so uncivilized people
scattered throughout the rest of the archipelago, the
&ldquo;non-Christian tribes,&rdquo; which dwell in the mountain
fastnesses, remote from &ldquo;the madding crowd,&rdquo; cut little
more figure, if any, in the general political equation, than the
American Indian does with us to-day. Take for instance the province of
Nueva Vizcaya, in the heart of north central Luzon. That was one of the
provinces of the First Judicial District I presided over in the
Islands. I think Nueva Vizcaya is Professor Worcester&rsquo;s
&ldquo;brag&rdquo; province, in the matter of non-Christian
anthropological specimens, both regarding their number and their
variety. Yet while I was there, though we knew those people were up in
the hills, and that there were a good many of them, the civilized
people all told us that the hill-tribes never bothered them. And on
their advice I have ridden in safety, unarmed, at night, accompanied
only by the court stenographer, over the main high-road running through
the central plateau that constitutes the bulk of Nueva Vizcaya
province, said plateau being surrounded by a great amphitheatre of
hills, the habitat of the Worcester pets.</p>
<p>The non-Christian tribes in the Philippines have been more widely
advertised in America than anything else connected with the Islands.
That advertisement has done more harm to the cause of Philippine
independence by depreciating American conceptions concerning Filipino
capacity for self-government, than anything that could be devised even
by the cruel ingenuity of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb578" href=
"#pb578" name="pb578">578</a>]</span>studied mendacity. And Professor
Worcester is the P. T. Barnum of the &ldquo;non-Christian tribe&rdquo;
industry. The Filipinos, though unacquainted with the career of the
famous menagerie proprietor <i>last</i> named, and his famous remark:
&ldquo;The American people love to be humbugged,&rdquo; understand the
malign and far-reaching influence upon their future destiny of the work
of Professor Worcester, and his services to the present Philippine
policy of indefinite retention with undeclared intention, through
humbugging the American people into the belief that the Islands must be
retained until the three hundred thousand or so Negritos, Igorrotes,
and other primitive wild peoples sprinkled throughout the archipelago
are &ldquo;reconstructed.&rdquo; Is it any wonder that the Filipinos do
not love the Professor? To keep him saddled upon them as one of their
rulers is as tactful as it would be to send Senator Tillman on a
diplomatic mission to Liberia or Haiti.</p>
<p>Not long ago the famous magazine publisher Mr. S. S. McClure, who, I
think, is trying to make his life one of large and genuine usefulness
for good, said to me that if we gave the Filipinos self-government we
would shortly have another Haiti or Santo Domingo on our hands. He must
have seen some of Professor Worcester&rsquo;s pictures of Igorrotes and
Negritos scattered through public documents related to the question of
Filipino capacity for self-government. Mr. McClure has never, I
believe, been in the Islands; and the cruelly unjust impression he had
innocently received was precisely the impression systematically
developed all these years through the Worcester kodak.</p>
<p>In February, 1911, there appeared an article in the <i>Sunset</i>
magazine for that month entitled &ldquo;The Philippines as I Saw
them.&rdquo; The contributor of the article is no less a personage than
the Honorable James F. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb579" href=
"#pb579" name="pb579">579</a>]</span>Smith, former Governor-General of
the Islands. At the top of the article one reads the legend
&ldquo;Illustrated by Photographs through the Courtesy of the Bureau of
Insular Affairs.&rdquo; If you read this legend understandingly, you
can, in so doing, hear the click of the Worcester kodak. General
Smith&rsquo;s article is smeared all over with such pictures. One is
merrily entitled &ldquo;Eighteen Igorrot Fledglings Hatched by the
American Bird of Freedom.&rdquo; Another is entitled &ldquo;Subano Man
and woman, Mindanao.&rdquo; Another is a picture of an Ifugao home in
the province of Nueva Vizcaya, hereinabove mentioned. Ifugao is the
name of one of the wild tribes, one of the results of Professor
Worcester&rsquo;s anthropological excavations of the last few years. In
front of the Ifugao home stands the master of the house, clothed in a
breech-clout. Next in the menagerie in the article under consideration
you find a group of Ifugao children, then a Bagobo of Mindanao, then
some other specimen with a curious name, in which there is a woman
naked from the waist up and a man in a loin-cloth. Then follows a
picture of a Tingyan girl from Abra province. And, to cap the climax,
among the last of these pictures you find a Filipino couple pounding
rice. The rice pounders are ordinary Filipinos. The woman is decently
dressed; the man is clothed only from the waist down, having divested
himself of his upper garment, as is customary in order to work at hard
labor more comfortably in hot weather. I do not so much blame General
Smith for this libellous panorama of pictures, scattered though they
are through an article by him on &ldquo;The Philippines as I Saw
them.&rdquo; He probably illustrated his article with what the Bureau
of Insular Affairs sent him, without giving much thought to the matter.
But the Bureau of Insular Affairs appears to neglect no occasion
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb580" href="#pb580" name=
"pb580">580</a>]</span>to parade the Philippine archipelago&rsquo;s
sprinkling of non-Christian tribes before the American public, fully
knowing that the hopes of the Filipinos for independence must depend
upon impressions received by the American people concerning the degree
of civilization they have reached.</p>
<p>For all these wanton indignities offered their pride and
self-respect, the Filipinos well know they are primarily indebted to
Professor Worcester and his non-Christian tribe bureau. The feud
between the Professor and the Filipino people&mdash;the bad blood has
been growing so long that the incident hereinafter related justifies
its being called a feud&mdash;has been peculiarly embittered by the
missionary aspect of the non-Christian industry. The great body of the
Filipino people, the whole six or seven millions of them, are
Catholics&mdash;most of them devout Catholics. Presumably, their desire
for salvation by the method handed down by their forefathers would not
be affected by a change from American political supervision to
independence. Yet the darkest thing ahead of Philippine independence
prospects is the Protestant missionary vote in the United States.
Bishop Brent, Episcopal Bishop of the Philippines, one of the noblest
and most saintly characters that ever lived, has devoted his life
apparently to missionary work in the Philippines, having twice declined
a nomination as Bishop of Washington (D.C.). The only field of endeavor
open to Bishop Brent and his devoted little band of co-workers is the
non-Christian tribes. It seems that the Catholic and Protestant
ecclesiastical authorities in the Islands get along harmoniously, a
kind of <i lang="la">modus vivendi</i> having been arranged between
them, by which the Protestants are not to do any proselyting among the
seven millions of Catholic Christians. So this field of endeavor is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb581" href="#pb581" name=
"pb581">581</a>]</span>the one Professor Worcester has been
industriously preparing during the last twelve years. Obviously, every
time Professor Worcester digs up a new non-Christian tribe he increases
the prospective harvest of the Protestants, thus corralling more
missionary vote at home for permanent retention of the Philippines.
Professor Worcester is quoted in a Manila paper as saying, &ldquo;I am
under no delusion as to what may be accomplished for the primitive wild
people. It takes time to reconstruct them.&rdquo; This remark is
supposed to have been made in a speech before the Young Men&rsquo;s
Christian Association of Manila. Neither is Mr. Taft under any delusion
as to how valuable is religious support for the idea of retaining the
Philippines as a missionary field. The nature of the above allusion to
Bishop Brent should certainly be sufficient to show that the writer
yields to no one in affectionate reverence and respect for that rare
and noble character. But neither Bishop Brent nor any one else can
persuade him that it is wise to abandon the principle that Church and
State should be separate, in order that our government may go into the
missionary business. Since it has become apparent that the Philippines
will not pay, the Administration has relied solely on missionary
sentiment. In one of his public utterances Mr. Taft has said in effect,
&ldquo;The programme of the Republican party with regard to the
Philippines is one which will make greatly for the spread of Christian
civilization throughout the Orient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foregoing reflections are not intended to raise an issue as to
the wisdom of foreign missions. They are simply intended to illustrate
how it is possible and natural for President Taft to consider Professor
Worcester &ldquo;the most valuable man we have on the Philippine
Commission.&rdquo; The Professor&rsquo;s menagerie is a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb582" href="#pb582" name=
"pb582">582</a>]</span>vote-getter. Also, President Taft&rsquo;s whole
Philippine policy being founded upon the theory that &ldquo;the great
majority&rdquo; of the Filipino people are in favor of alien thraldom
in lieu of independence, he tolerantly permits their editors to
&ldquo;let off steam&rdquo; through clamor for independence. This
privilege they do not fail to exercise to the limit. The attitude of
the Insular Government permits the native press much latitude of
&ldquo;sauciness,&rdquo; in deference to the American idea about
liberty of the press. In the exercise of this privilege during the last
few years the native press has gone the limit. However, there was no
way to stop them, on the principle to which we had committed ourselves.
The thing was very mischievous, and became utterly intolerable. There
was a native paper called <i lang="es">Renacimiento</i> (Renaissance).
This paper was long permitted to say things more or less seditious in
character which no self-respecting government should have tolerated.
This was done pursuant to the original theory, obstinately adhered to
up to date, that there was no real substantial unwillingness to
American rule. Of course, if this were true, newspaper noise could do
no harm. Therefore it was permitted to continue. Finally, however, like
a boy &ldquo;taking a dare,&rdquo; the <i lang="es">Renacimiento</i>
published an article on Professor Worcester which intimately and
sympathetically voiced the general yearning of the Filipino people to
be rid of the Professor. In so doing, however, the hapless editor
overstepped the limits of American license, and got into the toils of
the law, by saying things about the Professor that rendered the editor
liable to prosecution for criminal libel. The Professor promptly took
advantage of this misstep, to the great joy of the authorities, who had
been previously much goaded by independence clamor. The result was that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb583" href="#pb583" name=
"pb583">583</a>]</span>the paper was put out of business and the editor
was put in jail. No doubt the editor ought to have been put in jail,
but his incarceration incidentally served to tone down Filipino clamor
for independence. Subsequent to this <i lang="fr">coup
d&rsquo;&eacute;tat</i>, the Professor did a little venting of feelings
in his turn. He made a speech at the Y. M. C. A. on October 10, 1910,
which was a highly unchristian speech to be gotten off in an edifice
dedicated to the service of Christ. The Manila papers give only
extracts from the speech, and I have never seen a copy of it. From the
newspaper accounts, it seems that the Professor was determined to, and
did, relieve his feelings about the Filipinos. The Manila
<i>Cable-News</i> of October 11, 1910, quotes the Professor as
referring to his pets, the non-Christian tribes, as &ldquo;ancestral
enemies of the Christians.&rdquo; Thus for the first time is developed
an attitude of being champion of the uncivilized pagan remnant, left
from prehistoric times, against the Christians of the Islands. The
<i>Cable-News</i> also says that Professor Worcester &ldquo;laughed at
the idea that the Islands belonged to the <i>so-called civilized</i>
people and held that if the archipelago belonged to any one it
certainly belonged to its original owners the Negritos.&rdquo; This
remark about the &ldquo;<i>so-called <span class="corr" id="xd27e13164"
title="Source: civilised">civilized</span> people</i>&rdquo; was as
tactful as if President Taft should address a meeting of colored people
in a doubtful state and call them &ldquo;niggers.&rdquo; Another of the
Manila papers gives an account of the speech from which it appears that
the burly Professor succeeded in amusing himself at least, if not his
audience, by suggestions as to the superior fighting qualities of the
Moros over the Filipinos, which suggestions were on the idea that the
Moros would lick the Filipinos if we should leave the country. (The
Moros number 300,000, the Filipinos nearly 7,000,000.) The
Professor&rsquo;s remarks <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb584" href=
"#pb584" name="pb584">584</a>]</span>in this regard, according to the
paper, were a distinct reflection upon the courage of the Filipinos
generally as a people. The effect of Professor Worcester&rsquo;s speech
before the Y. M. C. A. may be well imagined. However the facts of
history do not leave the imagination unaided. The Philippine Assembly,
representing the whole Filipino people, and desiring to express the
unanimous feeling of those people with regard to the Worcester speech,
unanimously passed, soon after the speech was delivered, a set of
resolutions whereof the following is a translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Resolved that the regret of the Assembly be recorded
for the language attributed to the Honorable Dean C. Worcester,
Secretary of the Interior of the Philippine Government in a discourse
before the Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association, October 10, 1910.
It is improper and censurable in a man who holds a public office and
who has the confidence of the government. And as the statements made as
facts are false, slanderous, and offensive to the Philippine people,
their publication is a grave violation of the instructions given by
President McKinley which required that public functionaries should
respect the sensibilities, beliefs, and sentiments of the Philippine
people, and should show them consideration. The words and the conduct
of Mr. Worcester tend to sow distrust between the Americans and the
Filipinos, whose aspirations and duties should not separate them but
unite them in the pathway which leads to the progress and emancipation
of the Philippine people. The influence of Mr. Worcester has caused
injury to the feelings of the Filipinos, <i>encouraged race hatred, and
tended to frustrate the task undertaken by men of real good will</i> to
win the esteem, confidence, and respect of the Philippine people for
the Americans.</p>
<p>Resolved further that this House desires that these facts
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb585" href="#pb585" name=
"pb585">585</a>]</span>should be communicated to the President of the
United States through the Governor of the Philippines and the Secretary
of War.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presumably these resolutions were forwarded &ldquo;to the President
of the United States through the Governor of the Philippines and the
Secretary of War.&rdquo; But apparently they were pigeonholed when they
reached Washington. I stumbled on them in the Insular Affairs Committee
of the House of Representatives whither they had landed through Mr.
Slayden of Texas. The distinguished veteran Congressman from Texas,
being known as an enemy of all wrong things, was appealed to by certain
persons in the United States to bring the matter to the attention of
Congress. He did so by presenting to the House of Representatives an
American petition which embodied a copy of the resolutions of the
Philippine Assembly.</p>
<p>It thus becomes apparent that one of Professor Worcester&rsquo;s
principal elements of value is in bullying the Filipinos, and thereby
smothering manifestations of a desire for independence, the existence
of which desire is denied by President Taft&rsquo;s Administration. The
more the Filipinos cry for independence the greater seems the sin of
holding them in subjection. So that Professor Worcester is very
valuable in silencing independence clamor and thereby creating an
appearance of consent of the governed, when there is no consent of the
governed whatsoever.</p>
<p>In describing the discontent in distant provinces under brutal
pro-consuls, which contributed largely to the final disintegration of
the Roman Empire, Gibbon says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The cry of remote distress is ever faintly heard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb586" href="#pb586" name=
"pb586">586</a>]</span></p>
<p>The total failure of the above temperate, dignified, and vibrant
protest of the Philippine Assembly to reach the ears of the American
people is but another reminder that history repeats itself.

still is, that the Philippine Commission, which is the executive
authority, controls the appointment and assignment of the trial judges,

<p class="first">Is our Occupation of the Philippines to be temporary,
like our occupation of Cuba after the Spanish War, or
&ldquo;temporary&rdquo; like the British Occupation of Egypt since
1882? <i>The Unsettled Question.</i></p>
<p>The policy to be pursued is for Congress to determine. I have no

</div>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, known as the
Philippine Government Act, is entitled &ldquo;An Act <i>temporarily</i>
to provide&rdquo; a government for the Philippine Islands. The young
American who goes out to the Philippines to take a position with the
Insular Government there has usually read his share of Kipling, and his
imagination likes to analogize his prospective employment to the
British Indian Civil Service. The latter, however, offers a career. But
what does the former offer? Take the prospects of the rank and file, as
set forth by Mr. J. R. Arnold, of the Executive Bureau of the
Philippine Government, in an article published in the <i>North American
Review</i> for February, 1912. Suppose a young man goes out to the
Philippines at a salary of $1200. Mr. Arnold discusses fully and
frankly the cost of living in the Islands, and how much higher board,
lodging, etc., are out there than in the United States. He states
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb588" href="#pb588" name=
"pb588">588</a>]</span>that board and lodging will cost $15 to $20 a
month more than here. So that, so far, a salary of $1200 in the
Philippines would seem equivalent to a salary of say approximately $950
in the United States&mdash;say in Washington. Also he calls attention
to the fact that the government will pay your way <i>out</i>, but you
must get back the best way you can. He does not say so, but the walking
is not good all the way from Manila to Washington. Seriously, according
to the authority from whom we are quoting, it costs $225 to $300 to get
back. So if you come back at the end of a three years&rsquo;
stay&mdash;you must contract to stay at least that long&mdash;you must
have laid by, taking his maximum return fare as the more prudent figure
to reckon on, one hundred dollars a year to buy your return ticket. Mr.
Arnold does not say so, but it is a fact, that various little expenses
<i>will</i> creep in that are sure to amount, even with the most
rigidly frugal, to $50 per annum that you would never have spent in the
United States. You are hardly respectable in the Philippines if you do
not have a <i>muchacho</i>. <i>Muchacho</i>, in Spanish, means the same
as <i>gar&ccedil;on</i> in French, or valet in English. But
<i>muchachos</i> are as thick as cigarettes in the Philippines. And you
can hire one for about $5 a month. To resolve not to have a
<i>muchacho</i> in the Philippines would be like resolving at home
never to have your shoes shined, or your clothes pressed. It would be
contrary to the universal custom of the country, and would therefore be
&ldquo;impossible.&rdquo; You have not been long in the Philippines
before you get tired of telling applicants for the position of
<i>muchacho</i> that you do not want one, and, benumbed by the
universal custom, you accept the last applicant. You <i>must</i> figure
on a <i>muchacho</i> as one of your &ldquo;fixed charges.&rdquo; Count
then an extra $50 annual necessary expense that you <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb589" href="#pb589" name=
"pb589">589</a>]</span>would not have at home. If you do not succumb to
the <i>muchacho</i> custom, you will get rid of the $50 in other ways
fairly classifiable as necessary current expenses. Thus, if you take
from your $1200, worth $950 in Manila, as above stated, the $100 per
annum necessary to be laid by against your home-coming, and the other
$50 last suggested, your salary of $1200 per annum in Manila becomes
equivalent to one of $800 at home, so far as regards what you are
likely to save by strict habits of economy. In other words, to figure
how you are going to come out in the long run, if you go out as a $1200
man, while your social position will be precisely that of a man
commanding the same salary in a government position in Washington, you
must knock off a third of the $1200. This is not the way Mr. Arnold
states the case exactly. I am simply taking his facts, supplemented by
what little I have added, and stating them in a way which will perhaps
illustrate the case better to some people. Mr. Arnold says you are apt
to get up as high as $1500 and finally even to $1800 in three to five
years. Suppose you do have that luck. Still, if, as has been made plain
above, you must consider $1200 in Manila as equal to only $800 in
Washington (so far as regards what you are going to be able to save
each year), by the same token you must consider $1500 in Manila as
being equal to only $1000 in Washington, and $1800 as only $1200.</p>
<p>The utmost limit of achievement in the Philippine Government
service, the only one of the higher positions not subject to political
caprice, the only one regarded out there as a &ldquo;life
position&rdquo;&mdash;and this excepts neither the Governorship of the
Islands nor the Commissionerships&mdash;is the position of Justice of
the Supreme Court. The salary is $10,000 per annum, American money. But
there is not an American judge on that bench who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb590" href="#pb590" name=
"pb590">590</a>]</span>would not be glad at any moment to accept a
$5000 position as a United States District Judge at home. All of them
whom I know are most happily married. But I believe their wives would
quit them if they refused such an offer from the President of the
United States, or else get so unhappy about it that they would accept
and come home.</p>
<p>While we have now considered the case from bottom to top, we did not
originally figure on the young American going out to the Philippines
otherwise than single. In this behalf Mr. Arnold himself says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I do not think it can be fairly called other than
risky for an American to attempt to practise love in a cottage in the
Philippines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Says the late Arthur W. Fergusson&mdash;who gave his life to the
Philippine Civil Service&mdash;in his annual report for 1905, as
Executive Secretary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>The one great stumbling-block, and which no
legislative body can eradicate, is the fact that very few Americans
intend to make the Philippines their permanent home, or even stay here
for any extended period.</i> This is doubtless due to the location of
the islands, their isolation from centres of civilization and culture,
the enervating climate, lack of entertainment and desirable
companionship, and distance from the homeland. <i>Every clerk</i>, no
matter what his ideals or aspirations, <i>realizes after coming here
that he must at some time in the future return to the United States and
begin all over again</i>. After spending a year or more in the islands,
the realization that the sooner the change is made the better, becomes
more acute. This condition causes, doubtless, the class of men who are
not adventurous or fond of visiting strange climes to think twice
before accepting an appointment for service in these islands, and
generally to remain away, and a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb591"
href="#pb591" name="pb591">591</a>]</span>great majority of those who
do come here to leave the service again after a very short period of
duty.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13285src" href="#xd27e13285" name=
"xd27e13285src">1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Mr. Fergusson comes to the obvious but apparently unattainable
remedy, which he says is</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">to make a Philippine appointment a permanent means of
livelihood by providing an effective system of transfers to the Federal
service after a reasonable period of service here. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
Under the present regulations <i>influence must be brought to bear at
Washington</i> in order that requisition may be made by the Chief of
some bureau there for the services of a clerk desiring to transfer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see, if a Washington Bureau, say the Coast and Geodetic Survey,
or the Geological Survey, sends a man out to the Islands, he is never
for a moment separated from the Federal Civil Service or the Federal
Government&rsquo;s pay-roll. The same is true of civilian employees of
the army. But the man in the Insular Service, when he wants to get back
home, is little better off than if he were in the employ of the Cuban
Government, or the British Indian Government, or that of the Dutch East
Indies. Mr. Fergusson also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">It is believed to be useless to try to influence men
to come out here unless there is something <i>permanent</i> offered to
them at the expiration of a reasonable term of service. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
<i>The average European is content to live and die &ldquo;east of
Suez&rdquo;; the average American is not.</i> *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I am
firmly convinced that a <i>permanent</i> service under present
conditions is entirely out of the question.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can you have &ldquo;a <i>permanent</i> service&rdquo; unless you
have a definite declared policy? Why not declare <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb592" href="#pb592" name="pb592">592</a>]</span>the
purpose of our Government with the regard to the Islands?</p>
<p>In his annual report for 1906<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13326src"
href="#xd27e13326" name="xd27e13326src">2</a> Mr. Fergusson says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Our relations to the islands are such that the
education and specialization of a distinct body of high class men
purposely for this service as is done in England for the Indian
service, will probably be always a practical impossibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then goes on to reiterate his annual plea for a law providing for
transfer as <i>a matter of right, not of influence</i>, from the
Philippine Civil Service to the Federal Civil Service in the United
States, and tells of a very capable official of his bureau who got a
chance during the year just closed to transfer from the Philippines to
a $1400 government position in the United States, and was glad to get
it, although $1400 was &ldquo;considerably less than half what he
received here.&rdquo; Mr. Fergusson quickly gives the key to all this
in what he calls &ldquo;the haunting fear of having to return to the
States <i>in debilitated health and out of touch with existent
conditions, only to face the necessity of seeking a new
position</i>.&rdquo; He adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">That this is not a mere theory is proven by the number
of army (civilian) employees who contentedly remain year after
year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1907, Mr. Fergusson reports on the same subject<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e13350src" href="#xd27e13350" name="xd27e13350src">3</a>:
&ldquo;Matters do not seem to be improving,&rdquo; and that the
Director of the Insular Civil Service informs him that &ldquo;during
the fiscal year there were <i>five hundred voluntary separations from
the service by Americans</i>, of whom one hundred were college
graduates.&rdquo; He adds: &ldquo;When <i>the expense of getting and
bringing out new men, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb593" href=
"#pb593" name="pb593">593</a>]</span>of training them to their new work
is considered</i>, the <i>wastefulness of the present system is
evident</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You do not find any quotations from any of the Fergusson disclosures
in Mr. Arnold&rsquo;s <i>North American Review</i> article. He would
probably have lost his job, if he had quoted them. Yet the evils
pointed out by Mr. Fergusson come from one permanent source, the
uncertainty of the future of every American out there, due to the
failure of Congress to declare the purpose of the Government.</p>
<p>On January 30, 1908, Arthur W. Fergusson died in the service of the
Philippine Government. No general law putting that service on the basis
he pleaded for to the day of his death has ever yet been passed. Since
his death, his tactful successor appears to have abandoned further
pleading, and concluded to worry along with the permanently lame
conditions inherent in the uncertainty as to whether we are to keep the
Islands permanently or not, rather than embarrass President Taft by
discouraging young Americans from going to the Islands.</p>
<p>The report of the Governor-General of the Philippines for 1907,
Governor Smith, says<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13375src" href=
"#xd27e13375" name="xd27e13375src">4</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>American officials and employees have rarely made
up their minds to cast their fortunes definitely with the Philippines
or to make governmental service in the tropics a career.</i> Many of
those who in the beginning were so minded, due to ill health or the
longing to return to friends or relatives, changed front and preferred
to return to the home land, there to enjoy life at half the salary in
the environment to which they were accustomed. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* That
which operates probably more than anything else to induce good men
drawing good salaries to abandon the service *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* is the
knowledge that they have nothing to look forward to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb594" href="#pb594" name="pb594">594</a>]</span>when
broken health or old age shall have rendered them valueless to the
government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Congress should ever care to do anything to improve the
Philippine Civil Service and the status of Americans entering the same,
certainly the one supremely obvious thing to do is to make transfer
back to the civil service in the United States after a term of duty in
the Islands <i>a matter of right</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

killed in battle in the Philippines, from the beginning of the American
occupation to that date, as 380. This includes those wounded who
afterwards died of such wounds. His report for 1900,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e13413src" href="#xd27e13413" name="xd27e13413src">2</a>
covering the period from his 1899 report to May 5, 1900, gives the
number of Americans killed in battle from August 31, 1899, to May 1,
1900, as 258. General MacArthur succeeded General Otis in command of
the American forces in the Philippines on May 5, 1900. General
MacArthur&rsquo;s annual report for 1901,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13418src" href="#xd27e13418" name="xd27e13418src">3</a> gives the
number of Americans killed in battle between May 5, 1900, and June 30,
1901, as 245. Thus the total number of Americans killed in battle up to
the time the Civil Government was set up in 1901, was 883. The military
reports do not always give the insurgents killed during the periods
they cover. But on June 4, 1900, as we saw in a previous chapter,
General MacArthur reported the number of Filipinos killed up to that
time, so far as our records showed, to be something over 10,000.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb596" href="#pb596" name=
"pb596">596</a>]</span>General MacArthur&rsquo;s report, above quoted,
giving our killed for the period it covers (May 5, 1900, to June 30,
1901), at 245, gives the insurgent killed for the same period as 3854.
If we add this 3854 to the 10,000 killed up to about where May merged
into June in 1900, we have 13,854 Filipinos killed up to the time Judge
Taft was inaugurated as Governor, in 1901. There was no record, of
course, obtainable or attempted, by the Eighth Army Corps, of Filipinos
who were wounded and not captured and who subsequently died. It is
quite safe to assume that such fatalities must have swelled the
enemy&rsquo;s list up to the time of the setting up of the Civil
Government far above 16,000 killed. Thus, as has heretofore been
stated, the ratio of the enemy&rsquo;s loss to our loss was, literally,
at least 16 to 1, up to the time the civil government was set up.
General MacArthur&rsquo;s report for 1900<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13426src" href="#xd27e13426" name="xd27e13426src">4</a> would
seem to bear out the above ratio. He there gives the number of our
killed, from November 1, 1899, to September 1, 1900, including the
wounded who afterwards died of such wounds, at 268, and the
<span class="corr" id="xd27e13432" title=
"Source: Filipino">Filipinos</span> killed, &ldquo;as far as of
record,&rdquo; 3227. While these last figures make our killed for the
period they relate to, considerably over 200, and the enemy&rsquo;s
killed but a very small figure over 3200, still, making allowances for
the enemy&rsquo;s wounded that died afterwards, of which of course we
have no record, the 16 to 1 ratio would seem to give a fairly accurate
probable estimate of the relative loss of life.</p>
<p>These figures are explained by the facts, already noticed
hereinbefore, that most of our people knew how to shoot and the
Filipinos did not. The great part of their army were raw recruits who
did not understand the use of two sights on a rifle, and frequently
relied solely on the one at the muzzle, not even lifting up the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb597" href="#pb597" name=
"pb597">597</a>]</span>sight near the lock which when not in use lies
flat along the gun-barrel, with the result that they almost invariably
got the range too high and shot over our heads.</p>
<p>Because the military reports overlap each other in many instances,
it is not possible to state accurately how many men the Eighth Army
Corps lost by disease, but our loss chargeable to this account was not
far from our fatalities on the battlefield.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13441src" href="#xd27e13441" name="xd27e13441src">5</a></p>
<p>It is not possible to even approximate the enemy&rsquo;s loss other
than on the battlefield. The United States Coast and Geodetic Survey
Philippine Atlas gives the table estimating the population of the
various provinces of the Philippine archipelago prior to the American
occupation. This estimate gives the population of Batangas province at
312,192. <i>The American Census of the Philippines of 1903</i> gives
the population of Batangas province at 257,715.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13452src" href="#xd27e13452" name="xd27e13452src">6</a> This
would present a difference in the population of Batangas prior to 1898
and its population after the war of 54,477. The provincial secretary of
Batangas province made a report to Governor Taft on December 18,
1901<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13455src" href="#xd27e13455" name=
"xd27e13455src">7</a> on the condition of the province generally. This
report, as it appears in the Senate Document, is a translation from the
Spanish. The portion which relates to the reduction of the population
of Batangas province reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The mortality, caused no longer by the war, but by
disease, such as malaria and dysentery, has reduced to a little over
200,000 the more than 300,000 inhabitants which in former years the
province had.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb598" href="#pb598" name=
"pb598">598</a>]</span></p>
<p>Of course these appalling figures<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13468src" href="#xd27e13468" name="xd27e13468src">8</a> must be
taken with a grain of salt. In the first place, the man who furnished
them was merely reproducing the general impression of his neighbors as
to the diminution of the population of the province. He does not
pretend to be dealing with official statistics. On the other hand, all
of the yearly reports of the various native provincial officers are, as
a general rule, pathetically optimistic. They all seem to think it
their duty to present a hopeful view of the situation. In fact if you
read these reports one after the other, the various signers seem to vie
with one another in optimism as if their tenure of office depended upon
it. So that, balancing probabilities, it would seem unlikely that the
provincial secretary of Batangas would have stated more than what he at
least believed to represent actual conditions, and the results of the
war. A comparison of the Atlas population tables above mentioned with
the census tables of 1903 shows no very startling difference in the
population of any of the other provinces of the archipelago before and
after the war except Batangas. It is also notorious that Batangas
suffered by the war more than any other province in the Philippine
Islands. However, a glance at the table of population of the various
provinces of the Census of 1903<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13471src"
href="#xd27e13471" name="xd27e13471src">9</a> shows you fifty provinces
with a total of 7,635,426 people. While we will never know whether
Batangas did or did not lose one hundred thousand as a result of the
war and its consequences, still, if it did, the other forty-nine
provinces above mentioned must have lost as many more, that is to say,
must have lost another hundred thousand. So that while it is all a
matter of surmise, with nothing more <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb599" href="#pb599" name="pb599">599</a>]</span>certain to go on than
the foregoing, it would really seem by no means absurd to assume the
Filipino loss of life, other than on the battlefield, caused by the
war, and the famine, pestilence, and other disease consequent thereon,
at not far from 200,000 people. In more than one province, the people
died like flies, especially the women and children, as a result of
conditions incident to and consequent upon the war. This will not seem
an over-statement to men who have lived much among people that do not
know much about how to take care of themselves in the midst of great
calamities, people who <i>will</i> eat meat of animals carried off by
disease, in time of famine; who <i>will</i> drink water contaminated by
what may for euphony be called sewage; and who are unprovided with any
save traditional home remedies against cholera, small-pox, etc.</p>
<p>As to the cost of the Philippines in money, it used to be said in
the early days that we paid $20,000,000 for a $200,000,000
insurrection. Just what the Islands have cost us up to date in money it
is utterly impossible to figure out with any degree of certainty,
except that a safe minimum may be arrived at. Said the distinguished
Congressman from Texas, Honorable James L. Slayden, in a speech which
appears in the <i>Congressional Record</i> of February 25, 1908 (pp.
2532 <i>et seq.</i>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">On this point, and in reply to a resolution of the
Senate in 1902, the Secretary of War reported that the cost of the army
in the Philippines from June 30, 1898, to July 1, 1902, had been
$169,853,512.00. To this let us add $114,515,643.00, the admitted cost
of the army in the Philippines from May 1, 1902, to June 30, 1907, and
we will have a grand total of $284,369,155.00. That does not take into
account the additional cost of the navy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor, be it noted, does it count the $20,000,000 we <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb600" href="#pb600" name="pb600">600</a>]</span>paid
Spain for the Islands, which item, is, however included in another part
of Mr. Slayden&rsquo;s speech.</p>
<p>The only other estimate of what the Islands have cost, made in the
last few years, which seems to be specially worthy of consideration, is
one which appeared in the <i>New York Evening Post</i> of March 6,
1907. This estimate was prepared by one of the best trained and most
conservative newspaper men in the United States, Mr. Edward G. Lowry,
then Washington correspondent of the <i>Evening Post</i>, and since
1911, its managing editor. The total which Mr. Lowry arrives at is
$308,369,155, up to that time. There have been various absurd estimates
made recklessly without knowledge, but Mr. Lowry&rsquo;s estimate is
very carefully studied out, and presented in detail in the newspaper
referred to. From the testimony of Mr. Slayden and Mr. Lowry, given as
a result of their inquiries into the matter, it would thus seem that
the Islands must have cost us by the end of 1907 something like
$300,000,000. The Insular Government is now self-sustaining, except as
to military affairs.</p>
<p>The cost per annum of the Philippine (native) scouts, of which there
are 4000, is paid out of the United States Treasury, and amounts to
$2,000,000 per annum.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13509src" href=
"#xd27e13509" name="xd27e13509src">10</a> The number of American troops
in the islands for the last few years has been about 12,000. Those who
are wedded to the present Philippine policy of indefinite retention
with undeclared intention, insist that our military expenses in the
Philippines, in respect to the regular army out there, are not fairly
chargeable as a part of the current expenses of the Philippine
occupation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb601" href="#pb601" name=
"pb601">601</a>]</span>This argument must be admitted to have some
force as far as the navy is concerned, but as to the army it is clearly
without merit. Under the Act of Congress reorganizing the army of the
United States after the Spanish War, provision was made for a skeleton
army of about 60,000 men capable of expansion to something like 100,000
in time of war. The method of expansion thus contemplated was to have
companies of, say, for illustration, sixty men, in time of peace, which
companies could be recruited up to a war footing of one hundred men, in
time of war. The suggestion that the cost of the part of the regular
army which we have to keep in the Philippines is not chargeable to the
Philippines because those same troops would have to be somewhere in the
United States if they were not where they are, is not well taken. If we
did not need 12,000 men continually in the Philippines, the army could
be at once reduced by that much without affecting its present
organization. If we had no troops in the Philippines this would not
mean the absolute elimination from the army of enough <i>regiments</i>
to represent twelve thousand men. It would not eliminate any existing
organization. It would simply mean contraction of the number of men in
the several companies of the several regiments of the army toward a
peace basis to the extent of a total of twelve thousand men, more or
less. The War Department has long figured on the cost of an American
soldier in the Philippines per annum including his pay, allowances, and
transportation out and back, at $1000 per annum. The cost of 12,000
soldiers at $1000 per annum is $12,000,000, per annum. The conclusion
would, therefore, seem inevitable that the extra military current
expense chargeable to our occupation of the Philippines is $12,000,000,
per annum, outside the Philippine scouts, or, a total <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb602" href="#pb602" name="pb602">602</a>]</span>of
$14,000,000. Even if the Philippines have cost us $300,000,000, that is
no reason why we should continue to run a kindergarten for adults out
there, and let the Monroe Doctrine run to seed. &ldquo;Something&rdquo;
<i>is not</i> &ldquo;bound to turn up.&rdquo; The Philippine Islands
will <i>not</i> prove a blessing in disguise. In every war with a
nation having discontented colonial subjects, the enemy will always
strike the colony first, and hope for aid from the inhabitants
thereof.</p>
<p>Even if the Philippines <i>have</i> cost us $300,000,000, we are a
nation of nearly 100,000,000 people. So they have cost us, all told, in
the neighborhood of only about $3 a piece. And we subjugated them by
mistake, after freeing a less capable people, the Cubans.</p>
<p>The Panama Canal is to be finished in 1913. This means a splendid,
but free-for-all contest, for the trade of South America. In South
America we will meet a tremendous pro-German sentiment, and a by no
means inconsiderable anti-&ldquo;Yankee&rdquo; sentiment. The bigger
Germany&rsquo;s army and navy grows, the more she will loom up as the
one great menace to the peace of the world, and the one avowed enemy of
the Monroe Doctrine. We need to build up a Pan-American <i>esprit de
corps</i>, based on the instinct of self-defence. We <i>must</i> win
the good will of South America, and we cannot do it so long as we
insist, in another part of the world, upon the righteousness of the
principle of one Christian people policing a weaker Christian people,
ostensibly to keep them from having revolutions, and really in the hope
of ultimate profit. To free the Filipinos should be the first step we
take after the Panama Canal is completed toward getting ourselves
foot-loose entirely, with a view of getting everything from the
Canadian border to the Argentine wheat fields and beyond, solidly and
sincerely <i>for</i> the Monroe Doctrine. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb603" href="#pb603" name="pb603">603</a>]</span>In that direction
lies our only sensible and reasonable hope that the canal will get for
us the trade and friendship of South America. With such tremendous
issues at stake, what does it matter to the richest nation on earth
what the Philippines cost? What does it matter, anyhow, how much it
costs to do right? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb604" href="#pb604"

<p class="first">As a colony of Spain the Philippines enjoyed certain
special privileges in the way of trade with the &ldquo;mother
country.&rdquo; When at the beginning of our military occupation in
1898 General Otis detailed an army officer to take charge of the
Customs House, he continued for the time being the Spanish tariff laws
concerning imports and exports. On September 17, 1901, the Philippine
Commission passed a tariff act<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13561src"
href="#xd27e13561" name="xd27e13561src">1</a> fixing the duties on
imports into the Islands and also continuing to a considerable extent
the system of duties on Philippine exports inherited from the Spanish
r&eacute;gime. Among the products of the Philippine Islands on which
the Act of September 17, 1901, imposed an export tax were the
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Hemp, 75c. per 100 kilos<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13567src" href="#xd27e13567" name="xd27e13567src">2</a>; sugar,
5c. per 100 kilos; manufactured tobacco, $1.50 per 100 kilos; raw
tobacco, $1.50 down to 75c. per 100 kilos.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e13573src" href="#xd27e13573" name="xd27e13573src">3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb605" href="#pb605" name=
"pb605">605</a>]</span></p>
<p>On March 8, 1902, the United States Congress passed an Act,
&ldquo;temporarily to provide revenue for the Philippine Islands and
for other purposes.&rdquo; The Act of 1902 re-enacted the
Commission&rsquo;s tariff law for the Philippines of September 17,
1901, with one change, hereinafter to be discussed, as to its export
tax features. As to the tariffs to be collected at our custom-houses on
Philippine products shipped to the United States, the Act of 1902
reduced the rates fixed by the Dingley tariff to seventy-five per cent.
of said rates. That was all Congress did in the way of lowering our
tariff wall to Philippine products until 1909, when the Payne-Aldrich
tariff bill became a law. This twenty-five per cent. reduction was no
better than no reduction whatever would have been.</p>
<p>Governor Taft pleaded very earnestly with Congress, at the time of
the passage of the Philippine Tariff Act of March 8, 1902, for a
<i>substantial</i> reduction of the Dingley tariff rate on sugar and
tobacco, so as to give his &ldquo;constituents&rdquo;&mdash;his
Filipinos&mdash;something in lieu of the markets they had had under
Spain. But our sugar and tobacco interests defeated his efforts,
because they feared what they termed &ldquo;competition with cheap
Asiatic labor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Act of Congress of March 8, 1902, repealed the export duties
imposed by the Act of the Philippine Commission of September 17, 1901,
as to exports to the United States, <i>leaving unrepealed</i>, however,
<i>the export duty on Philippine products shipped to foreign
countries</i>. Section 2 of said Act of 1902 provided, as to exports
from the Philippines to the United States, that the rates of duty upon
products of the Philippine Archipelago coming into the United States,
should be less any duty or tax levied, collected, and paid thereon
(under the Act of the Philippine Commission of September <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb606" href="#pb606" name="pb606">606</a>]</span>17,
1901, aforesaid) upon the shipment thereof from the Philippine
Archipelago. This sounds liberal enough. It is, as far as it goes. But
what those familiar with the hemp infamy of the Act of 1902 call
&ldquo;the joker&rdquo; in it, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">All <i>articles</i>, the growth and product of the
Philippine Islands, <i>admitted</i> into the ports of the United States
<i>free of duty</i> under the provisions of this act, and coming
directly from said islands to the United States, for use and
consumption therein, shall be hereafter exempt from any export duties
imposed in the Philippine Islands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also sounds liberal, on first reading, but its object was, and
its effect has been, to enable the American Hemp Trust to corner and
control the Manila hemp industry. <i>There is but one article of
Philippine export which any one in the United States is interested in,
that was admitted into the United States free of duty under the Dingley
Act.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e13611src" href="#xd27e13611" name=
"xd27e13611src">4</a> <i>That article is hemp.</i> The object of the
law was to favor Americans interested in exporting hemp from Manila to
the United States as against Europeans exporting it to England and
other foreign countries. This does not look, on its face, either
unpatriotic or un-Christian. It is not unpatriotic or un-Christian,
ordinarily, to favor your own people, as against their foreign
competitors. The moral quality of such favoritism, however, must depend
on who is to pay for it. Under the Act of 1902, the Manila authorities
have always collected an export tax on hemp coming to the United
States, just as they do on hemp going from Manila to foreign countries,
exactly as if the law abolishing the export tax on hemp coming to the
United States had never been passed. Later, on proof that the hemp was
<i>in fact</i> carried to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb607" href=
"#pb607" name="pb607">607</a>]</span>the United States and used and
consumed therein, they refund the export tax. This is on the idea that
they cannot tell where the hemp is <i>going to</i> until they know
where it went to, nor where it is <i>going to be</i> &ldquo;used and
consumed&rdquo; until they know where it <i>was in fact</i> finally
&ldquo;used and consumed.&rdquo; Of course the small farmer is in no
position to follow his bale of hemp into the markets of the world and
show, if it happens to go to the United States, that it did in fact go
there and that it was there &ldquo;used and consumed,&rdquo; and,
finally obtaining the proof of this, submit it to the Manila Government
and get his little export tax on his bale of hemp refunded. Only the
big buyer&rsquo;s agents at Manila are in a position to do this. So the
hemp crop is bought and moved under conditions which are the same as if
<i>all</i> hemp were subject to an export tax. And only the big fish
get the benefit. For instance, the International Harvester Company has
its hemp buyers at Manila. And as to the part of the Philippine hemp
crop it handles, it can, of course, follow the hemp to its ultimate
consumption in the United States, make the proof, and get the
refund.</p>
<p>The wealth of the Philippines is practically entirely agricultural.
Neither mining nor manufactures cut any appreciable figure. Hemp,
sugar, tobacco, and copra<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13637src" href=
"#xd27e13637" name="xd27e13637src">5</a> are the chief staples and main
exports, and of the first of these Secretary of War Taft says in one of
his reports:<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13640src" href="#xd27e13640"
name="xd27e13640src">6</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The chief export in value and quantity from the
Philippines is Manila hemp, it amounting to between 60 and 65 per cent.
of the total exports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb608" href="#pb608" name=
"pb608">608</a>]</span></p>
<p>Let us see just how far, according to the annual reports of our own
agents in the Philippines&mdash;those charged by us with governing
them,&mdash;this piece of legislation gotten through by &ldquo;special
privilege&rdquo; has depressed the Manila hemp industry, the chief
source of wealth of the Islands. And before we even get to the main
trouble, let us permit the Insular Government to &ldquo;place on the
screen,&rdquo; as a preliminary &ldquo;view,&rdquo; a glance at what
the instinct of self-preservation of American sugar and tobacco
interests, fearing competition from &ldquo;cheap Asiatic labor,&rdquo;
have deemed it necessary to do to the Philippine sugar and tobacco
industries, through the Dingley tariff. The annual report of the
Philippine Commission for 1904, before it gets to the subject of hemp,
draws a most gloomy picture of how we killed the markets for sugar and
tobacco the Islands had under Spain, and gave them none instead. They
speak of &ldquo;the languishing state of these industries&rdquo; (p.
26), and describe a state of affairs that sounds more like Egypt under
Pharaoh than anything else, including a cattle disease that carried off
ninety per cent. of the beasts of burden of the country, and wholesale
destruction of crops by locusts.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13652src"
href="#xd27e13652" name="xd27e13652src">7</a> What they have to say of
the annual tribute levied by the American Hemp Trust, through Congress,
on the Manila hemp industry, should not be re-stated, but quoted. They
say:<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13655src" href="#xd27e13655" name=
"xd27e13655src">8</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We desire to call attention to the injustice effected
upon the revenues of the islands by section 2 of the Act of Congress
approved March 8, 1902, which provides that the Philippine Government
shall refund all export duties imposed upon articles exported from the
islands into and consumed in the United States. Under the provisions of
this section there has been collected in the Philippine <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb609" href="#pb609" name=
"pb609">609</a>]</span>Islands, since its enactment down to the close
of the fiscal year 1904, the sum of $1,060,460.20 United States
currency, which is refundable. <i>These refundable duties are
principally upon hemp exportations to the United States, and are in
effect a gift of that amount to the manufacturers of the United States
who use hemp in their operations.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">It is manifestly a discrimination in favor of our
manufacturers as against those of foreign countries. No good reason is
perceived why this <i>bounty to American manufacturers</i> should be
extracted from the treasury of the Philippine Islands, and it is
respectfully submitted that the law authorizing it should be
repealed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The annual report of the Philippine Commission for 1905, after the
usual complaint about being made a political football by Benevolent
Assimilation on the one side, and Louisiana and our sugar-beet States
on the other, and the usual annual and true description of the
consequent poverty, says concerning hemp:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We have several times in our reports called attention
to the practical workings of that portion of the Act of Congress
approved March 8, 1902, which provides for the refund of duties paid on
articles exported from the Philippine Islands to the United States and
consumed therein, and have as repeatedly recommended its repeal. <i>It
is a direct burden upon the people of the Philippine Islands, because
it takes from the insular treasury export duties collected from the
people and gives them to manufacturers of hemp products in the United
States.</i> These manufacturers were already prosperous before this
bounty was given <i>them</i> and <i>it seems hardly consistent with our
expressions of purpose to build up and develop the Philippine Islands
when we are</i> thus enriching a few of our own people at their
expense.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13692src" href="#xd27e13692" name=

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb610" href="#pb610" name=

<p>By the end of the fiscal year 1905 (June 30), the American importers
of Manila hemp&mdash;of whom the International Harvester Company and
its allied interests are the most influential&mdash;had, under the
operation of the rebate system based on the Act of 1902, milked the
Philippine people to the tune of about $1,000,000. Says the Philippine
Commission&rsquo;s annual report for 1905, immediately after the
passage last above quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The amount of duties refunded under this act to
manufacturers in the United States during the three years ending June
30, 1905, is $1,057,251.12. Many of the departments of the government
are much hampered in their operations because of the lack of funds,
notably the bureau of education, and were the sum thus taken available
for educational purposes, to say nothing of any other, the government
would be enabled to give instruction to thousands of Filipino children
whom they are now unable to reach and who must remain steeped in
ignorance because of the lack of funds to provide such instruction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Said the Manila Chamber of Commerce to the Taft Congressional party
in August, 1905: &ldquo;The country is in a state of financial
collapse.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13706src" href=
"#xd27e13706" name="xd27e13706src">10</a></p>
<p>Says the Philippine Commission&rsquo;s report for 1906 (pt. 1, p.
68):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The Commission has repeatedly called attention in its
reports to the action of Congress providing for a refund of duties paid
on articles exported from the Islands to the United States and consumed
therein. The reasons that led the Commission heretofore to recommend
the repeal of that provision are still operative. Since the passage of
that act on March 8, 1902, the amount of duties collected and paid into
the Philippine treasury and handed over to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb611" href="#pb611" name=
"pb611">611</a>]</span>manufacturers in the United States down to June
30, 1906, is $1,471,208.47. <i>This money has been taken out of the
poverty of the insular treasury to be delivered directly into the hands
of manufacturers of cordage and other users of Philippine hemp in the
United States for their enrichment.</i> The cordage interests are
prosperous and do not need this help; the Philippine Islands are poor.
Legislation which takes money directly from the Philippine treasury and
passes it over to a particular industry in the United States is not
founded on sound principles of political economy or of justice to the
Filipinos. We renew our recommendation for the repeal of this
provision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You also find in the Commission&rsquo;s report for 1906 the usual
annual protests against the Dingley tariff on Philippine sugar and
tobacco. Said the Honorable Henry C. Ide in an article in the <i>New
York Independent</i> for November 22, 1906, written shortly after he
retired from the office of Governor-General of the Philippines and
returned to the United States: &ldquo;By annexation we killed the
Spanish market for Philippine sugar and tobacco, and our tariff shuts
these products from the United States market, and to-day both these
[industries] are practically prostrated.&rdquo; In their annual report
for 1907, the Philippine Commission say with regard to the American
corner on Philippine hemp:<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13731src" href=
"#xd27e13731" name="xd27e13731src">11</a> &ldquo;The price of hemp has
fallen from an average of twenty pesos ($10 American money) per
picul<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13734src" href="#xd27e13734" name=
"xd27e13734src">12</a> to thirteen pesos per picul.&rdquo; It thus
appears that by judicious manipulation of the hemp market at Manila,
through the leverage of the refund system, based on collection and
subsequent refunding of the export tax on hemp coming to the United
States, the Manila agents of the American hemp manufacturers had, as
early as 1907, beat the price of hemp down to not far above half of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb612" href="#pb612" name=
"pb612">612</a>]</span>what it had been formerly. To-day (1912) the
Filipino hemp farmer gets for his hemp just one half what he got just
ten years ago. During all this period of economic depression, the
public utterances and State papers both of President Roosevelt and Mr.
Taft are full of such preposterous stuff as the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">No great civilized power has ever managed with such
wisdom and disinterestedness the affairs of a people committed by the
accident of war to its hands.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13742src"
href="#xd27e13742" name="xd27e13742src">13</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Taft were <i>publicly
pretending</i> to believe. But at practically the same time, during as
dark a year, economically, as the American occupation has seen, 1907,
let us see what they were privately admitting to their intimate
friends.</p>
<p>In the <i>North American Review</i> for January 18, 1907, in an
article contributed to that <i>Review</i> by the author of this volume,
our treatment of the Philippine people, through our Congress, was
briefly discussed. The article chanced to attract the attention of Mr.
Andrew Carnegie, who gave a considerable sum of money to have it
reprinted and distributed. Some correspondence followed between us, in
the course of which Mr. Carnegie stated that he had been at the White
House shortly before writing me, and described what happened as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">When at supper with the President [Mr. Roosevelt]
recently, pointing to Judge Taft [then Secretary of War], who sat
opposite, he [President Roosevelt] said: &ldquo;Here are the two men in
all the world most anxious to get out of the Philippines.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb613" href="#pb613" name=
"pb613">613</a>]</span></p>
<p>In another letter Mr. Carnegie described this same incident, this
other letter&rsquo;s version of President Roosevelt&rsquo;s
supper-table remark being:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Here are the two men in America most anxious to get
rid of them [the Philippines].<a class="noteref" id="xd27e13768src"
href="#xd27e13768" name="xd27e13768src">14</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now why all this public boasting about our
&ldquo;disinterestedness,&rdquo; when, if he had been a Filipino,
Colonel Roosevelt would probably have hunted up all the American
speeches of 1776 about taxation without representation, and played
hide-and-seek with the public prosecutor at Manila, to see how far he
could violate the sedition statute without getting in jail? And why
this private admission to his friend Mr. Carnegie, which neither he nor
Mr. Taft has ever publicly made? Why did he not send a message to
Congress showing up the hemp rebate system? Simply because to do so
would lose support for the Administration, would alienate powerful
interests from the fatuous policy of Benevolent Assimilation bequeathed
to Mr. Roosevelt by Mr. McKinley. His party was irrevocably committed
to indefinite retention of the Islands. It was like Lot&rsquo;s wife.
It could not turn back. So the protected and subsidized interests were
permitted to continue to prey upon the Philippine people. Tariff evils
were never President Roosevelt&rsquo;s specialty. Nor has war against
intrenched privilege of any sort ever been Mr. Taft&rsquo;s specialty.
Mr. Taft went out to the Philippines in 1907 to open the Philippine
Assembly. In 1908 he came back and made a report to President Roosevelt
which is as bland as his Winona declaration that the Payne-Aldrich bill
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb614" href="#pb614" name=
"pb614">614</a>]</span>is &ldquo;the best tariff bill the Republican
party ever passed.&rdquo; It makes the American reader&rsquo;s heart
swell with pious pride at what he is doing for his &ldquo;little brown
brother,&rdquo; in the matter of vaccination, sewers, school-books, and
the like. President Roosevelt sent this report to Congress, accompanied
by a message, from which we have already quoted. In that same message
he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I question whether there is a brighter page in the
annals of international dealing between the strong and the weak than
the page which tells of our doings in the Philippines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently, Messrs. Roosevelt and Taft thought, in 1907, that
granting the Filipinos a little debating society solemnly called a
legislative body, but wholly without any real power, was ample
compensation for deserted tobacco and cane plantations and for the
price of hemp being beat down below the cost of production by
manipulation through an Act of Congress passed for the benefit of
American hemp manufacturers. If we had had a Cleveland in the White
House about that time, he would have written an essay on taxation
without representation, with the hemp infamy of this Philippine Tariff
Act of 1902 as a text, and sent it to Congress as a message demanding
the repeal of the Act. But the good-will of the Hemp Trust is an asset
for the policy of Benevolent Assimilation. The Filipino cannot vote,
and the cordage manufacturer in the United States can. No conceivable
state of economic desolation to which we might reduce the people of the
Philippine Islands being other than a blessing in disguise compared
with permitting them to attend to their own affairs after their own
quaint and mutually considerate fashion, the Hemp Trust&rsquo;s rope,
tied into a slip-knot by the Act of 1902, must not be removed from
their throats. By judicious manipulation of sufficient hemp rope,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb615" href="#pb615" name=
"pb615">615</a>]</span>you can corral much support for Benevolent
Assimilation. Therefore, to this good hour, the substance of the hemp
part of the Philippine Tariff Act of March 8, 1902, remains upon the
statute books of the United States, to the shame of the nation.</p>
<p>At last, under the Payne tariff law of 1909, Mr. Taft&rsquo;s long
and patient quiet work with Congressional committees prevailed upon
Congress and the interests to admit Philippine sugar and tobacco to
this country free of duty, up to amounts limited in the Act.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e13785src" href="#xd27e13785" name=
"xd27e13785src">15</a> Since then you find the reports of our American
officials in the Philippines palpitating with gratitude to Congress. As
a matter of fact all Congress had said to the Filipinos by its action
may be summed up about thus: &ldquo;The sugar and tobacco interests of
this country have at last realized that such little of the sugar and
tobacco you raise as may stray over to this side of the world will not
be in the least likely to hurt them. Therefore they have graciously
decided, in their benignity, to permit you to live, provided you do not
get too prosperous.&rdquo; But this very same Payne bill continued the
export tax features of the Act of 1902. Section 13 of the Payne bill is
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Section 13. That upon the exportation to any foreign
country from the Philippine Islands, or the shipment thereof to the
United States or any of its possessions, of the following articles
there shall be levied, collected, and paid thereon the following export
duties: <i>Provided</i>, <i>however</i>, <span class="corr" id=
"xd27e13797" title="Source: That">that</span> all articles the growth
and product of the Philippine Islands coming directly from said
islands, to the United States or any of its possessions for use and
consumption therein shall be exempt from any export duties imposed in
the Philippine Islands:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Let us briefly glance at the net results of this law, and its
predecessor, the Act of 1902, the export features of which it
re-enacted. It is important that every fair-minded American who can
possibly spare the time should take such a glance at what Congress has
done to the Philippine hemp industry, because of the obvious bearing
that such taxation without representation will probably have on the
attitude of the Philippine people whenever we get into a war with a
foreign power. Certainly the legislation Congress has perpetrated upon
them, at the behest of special interests in the United States, has not
soothed the original desire of those people to be free and
independent.</p>
<p>At page 27 of the report of the Philippine Collector of Customs for
1910, a table is given showing the export duties subject to refund
collected under the Act of Congress of March 8, 1902, and deposited in
the Philippine treasury to the credit of the Insular Government at the
end of each fiscal year (June 30), as follows:</p>

<p>If you have the time and inclination, you can easily figure out the
annual &ldquo;rake-off&rdquo; of the American hemp importers from the
above table. For instance, take the last year, 1910: 99,305,102 kilos
at 75 cents per 100 kilos is $744,788.26, which is more than 4% of
$17,404,922, the total value of the hemp crop of the archipelago for
that year. Add this $744,788.26 to the $3,384,183.60 shown by the above
table of refundable duties collected from 1902 to 1909 inclusive, and
you have over $4,000,000 rebates accruing to American importers of
Manila hemp from 1902 to 1910 inclusive.</p>
<p>In his remarks on Section 13 of the Payne Law of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb618" href="#pb618" name="pb618">618</a>]</span>1909
(above set forth), in the House of Representatives, May 13,
1909,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14058src" href="#xd27e14058" name=
"xd27e14058src">16</a> Hon. Oscar W. Underwood said, in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">When you put a tax on your people for engaging in
export trade, to that extent you lessen their ability to successfully
meet their foreign competitor and reduce the territory in which they
can successfully dispose of their surplus products abroad. Our
forefathers in writing the Constitution of the United States,
recognizing the false principle on which an export tax was based, put
it in the fundamental law of our land that the United States Government
should not lay export taxes. <i>If we enact this law, we write into the
statute book for the Philippine Islands, legislation which is little
short of barbarous, legislation that no government in the civilized
world except Turkey, and Persia, and other second-class nations
countenance to-day.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the hemp interests won out and the section was adopted. In an
argument for the repeal of the export tax, delivered in the House of
Representatives August 19, 1911, the Philippine delegate, Hon. Manuel
L. Quezon, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">There is one section in the Philippine tariff law,
approved August 5, 1909, which is <i>seriously injuring the proper
commercial development of the islands</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course the earnestness with which Mr. Quezon pleaded his cause
may be imagined from the circumstance that, as he says, he is
continually advised by letters from his people, and verily believes
that <i>if the export tax is not taken off soon the Philippine hemp
industry will be entirely destroyed</i>, and the hemp farmers will have
to take to raising something else in lieu of hemp, because the present
prices hardly permit them to live. In the course of his speech Mr.
Quezon offered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb619" href="#pb619" name=
"pb619">619</a>]</span>the following truly eloquent and absolutely
unanswerable argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Although it has been decided by the Supreme Court of
the United States that the provisions of the Constitution are not in
force in the Philippines, I have serious doubts as to whether said
decision also meant that this Government has the power to enact laws
for the islands which are expressly prohibited by the Constitution in
the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is through the courtesy of Mr. Quezon that such light as I may
have been able to throw on the subject has been obtained. He has shown
me letters from the Philippine Chamber of Commerce at Manila and other
commercial organizations prophesying ruin to the Manila hemp industry
in the event the export tax should continue. One of these letters is
addressed to the two Philippine Commissioners in Congress, Mr. Legarda
and Mr. Quezon. It informs them of the hopes of the Filipinos at Manila
that they, Messrs. Legarda and Quezon, may be successful in their
campaign to get the law repealed and that many of them (the Filipinos
at Manila) feel hopeful of results in that regard. Speaking for their
fellow countrymen at Manila, they say, &ldquo;The optimists are of the
opinion that the matter being in such good hands as yours will be
carried to a successful conclusion.&rdquo; Then they give the darker
side of the picture thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">But the representatives at this capital of the famous
syndicate, the International Harvester Company, are of the opinion that
we will be able to accomplish nothing, and theirs is an opinion to
which great weight should be attached, because <i>the vast interests
which that concern represents can set in motion powerful influences to
keep the present law as it is</i>, since it concerns their interest to
do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb620" href="#pb620" name=
"pb620">620</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mr. Quezon has also shown me a letter written to him, March 30,
1911, by his and my warm personal friend, Hon. James F. Smith, formerly
Governor-General of the Philippines, now (1912) Judge of the Court of
Customs Appeals at Washington, D. C., in which letter General Smith
says, concerning the operation of that part of the export tax act of
March 8, 1902 (continued by the Payne Tariff Law of 1909) by which
American manufacturers are relieved from the payment of the export tax
on Manila hemp:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>In effect this really and truly amounts to the
payment by the Philippine Government and the Filipino people of a large
subsidy to American manufacturers of hemp.</i> More than that, this
concession to the American manufacturer, by enabling him to undersell
his British competitor, gives him an undue control of the situation and
has put him in a position, to some extent, to control prices for the
raw product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that the American people had better look to their own
liberties, when they remember that in the campaign for the Republican
nomination in 1912, the Roosevelt Headquarters gave out that pending
the Roosevelt dictation of Mr. Taft&rsquo;s nomination in 1908, the
International Harvester Company furnished a floor of its Chicago
building to the Taft people, this interesting fact being part of the
leakage from the Roosevelt-Taft quarrel caused by the Roosevelt charge
that Mr. Taft was unfit for re-election because he &ldquo;meant well
<i>feebly</i>&rdquo;; and when it is recalled, on the other hand, that
in the Roosevelt campaign of 1912 for the presidential nomination for a
third term, Mr. George W. Perkins,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14112src"
href="#xd27e14112" name="xd27e14112src">17</a> <span class=

what was virtually an export tax, the opinion of the court cites the
absolute inhibition against such a tax imposed by our Federal
Constitution, and says concerning the wise theory on which this
fundamental tenet of our government rests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The requirement of the Constitution is that exports
should be free from any governmental burden.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision then goes on to elaborate on what it terms &ldquo;that
freedom from governmental burden in the matter of exports which it was
the intention of our Constitution to protect and preserve.&rdquo;
Finally, the court uses an expression which is certainly a stinging
rebuke to any law-making power that permits the selfish greed of a
little set of importers to get a law passed imposing for their special
benefit a paralyzing export tax on the chief staple of a helpless
colony:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The power to tax is the power to destroy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Mr. Quezon has no vote in Congress and his voice was not heard,
at least not heeded. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb622" href="#pb622"
name="pb622">622</a>]</span></p>
<p>The summation of the whole matter is this: Both the Philippine
people and the American people are, and long have been, suffering from
unjust taxation through laws for which special selfish financial
interests in the United States, exercising grossly undue influence on
governmental action, are responsible. Neither will ever get relief
until the government of this nation is wrested from the control of the
money-hogs and restored to the people. Until that is done, selfish
greed will continue to sow sedition in the Philippines, and socialism
in the United States. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb623" href=

<h2 class="main">The Rights of Man</h2>
<div class="epigraph">
<p class="first">The rights of man cannot be changed. It is the
government which attempts to change them that must
change.&mdash;<span class="sc">Webster.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was the homely common sense of Mr. Lincoln that
first reminded us most vividly how like to the sins of an individual
are those of a nation. To the Southern man who admires Mr. Lincoln as
one of the great figures of all time, he seems like a great physician,
who, with malice toward none and with charity for all, kept vigil for
four years at the bedside of a sick nation through all the long agony
of its efforts to throw off from its system the inherited curse of
slavery. Of course, human slavery was a relic of barbarism. But in
fixing the Rights of Man, the founders of the Republic actually
overlooked the fact that a negro was a human being. So that, vast
property rights having accrued pursuant to that mistake, the march of
progress had to wipe them out, no matter whom it hurt financially. The
enormity of the iniquity of human slavery did not dawn suddenly and
exclusively upon William Lloyd Garrison. He is not the sole, original
inventor and patentee of the idea. Lord Macaulay&rsquo;s father was
doing the same sort of agitating in England about the same time.
Westminster Abbey has its monument to the elder Macaulay, just as
Commonwealth Avenue has its monument to the elder Garrison.
Simultaneous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb624" href="#pb624" name=
"pb624">624</a>]</span>like stirrings occurred elsewhere throughout
Christendom. But, of course, in America, arguments for the emancipation
of the slave first took root most readily in a thrifty section of our
liberty-loving country which had nothing to lose by abolition.</p>
<p>John Quincy Adams once said that our government was &ldquo;an
experiment upon the heart of man.&rdquo; It is because this government
of the people by the people for the people was a deliberate and
thoughtful attempt upon the part of its founders to apply the Golden
Rule as a doctrine of international and inter-individual law, that we
believe our form of government is the last hope of mankind. It is, as
we conceive it, the voice of humanity raised in protest against the
proposition that might makes right. It is, as we conceive it, a
government which entered the lists of the nations as the champion of
the human mind, in the great struggle of Mind for the mastery over
Matter, the world-old struggle between Good and Evil, Light and
Darkness. Our government, like everything else, must follow the law of
its being, or die. Its first great sin in violation of the Rights of
Man was due to heredity. We inherited the institution of slavery, the
governmental exception to the rule that all men are created with equal
right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This was a sin
against human liberty, one of the &ldquo;unalienable&rdquo; Rights of
Man, upon which the Republic purported to be builded. The consequences
of that sin are still with us; but, except for the occasional
bloody-shirt waver, whose intellectual resources are not sufficient to
provide him with a live issue, we are meeting those consequences, as a
nation, bravely, and with the mutual forbearance born of the fact that
none are wholly free from responsibility for present difficulties.</p>
<p>Our second great national sin was a yielding to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb625" href="#pb625" name=
"pb625">625</a>]</span>temptation of the environment which arose,
unforeseen, after a splendid war waged for the Rights of Man against
Spain in Cuba. The Philippine war was waged to subjugate the Filipino
people, because Mr. McKinley believed it would be financially
profitable to us to own the islands, and in the face of the fact that
the only thing he knew officially about the Filipino people was that
Admiral Dewey thought them superior to the Cubans and more capable of
self-government. The war in the Philippines was, therefore, a war
against the Rights of Man. Nowhere in any state paper has any American
statesman, soldier, or sailor, had the temerity to invoke the name of
God in connection with the retention of the Philippine Islands. Nowhere
in any American state paper connected with the Philippines is there any
reference to &ldquo;a decent respect to the opinions of mankind.&rdquo;
The sin of our Philippine policy is that it is a denial of the right of
a people to pursue happiness <i>in their own way</i> instead of in
<i>somebody else&rsquo;s</i> way. It is a denial of the very principles
in maintenance of which we went to war against Spain to free Cuba, as
we had previously gone to war against England to free ourselves.</p>
<p>Now the reason the nation blundered into taking the Philippines was
that it believed the Filipinos to be, not a people, but a jumble of
savage tribes. But the reason the men who controlled the action of the
government at the time took the Philippines was because they believed
they would pay. Nevertheless, there was a sufficient number of our
fellow-citizens&mdash;controlled, some by altruistic motives and some
by sordid motives&mdash;to cause the nation to follow the lead of those
then in control. If the men then in control had taken the people into
their confidence, the blunder would never have been made. If the
correspondence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb626" href="#pb626" name=
"pb626">626</a>]</span>between Mr. McKinley and the Paris Peace
Commission in the fall of 1898, from which the injunction of secrecy
was not removed until 1901, had been given out at the time, the treaty
would never have been ratified except after some such declaration as to
the Philippines as was made concerning Cuba, some reaffirmance of
allegiance to faith in our cardinal tenet&mdash;the right of every
people to pursue happiness in their own way, free from alien
domination. The Bacon resolution of 1899, which was along this line,
was defeated only by the deciding vote of the presiding officer, the
Vice-President of the United States. The passage of that resolution
would have prevented the Philippine Insurrection. Had it passed, the
Filipinos would no more have had occasion to think of insurrection than
the Cubans did. It was Mr. McKinley alone who decided to take the
Philippines. Congress was not called together in extra session. The
people were not consulted, except from the rear-end of an observation
car.</p>
<p>Most people, whether they be lawyers or not, are more or less
acquainted with the doctrine of what is called in law a &ldquo;<i>bona
fide</i> purchaser without notice.&rdquo; No man can claim to be a
<i>bona fide</i> purchaser without notice, when he knows enough about
the subject matter of his purchase to put him on reasonable notice of
the existence of facts which, had he taken the trouble to verify them,
would have caused him to halt and not purchase. The correspondence in
1898, made public in 1901, withheld by Mr. McKinley until after his
second election in 1900, is sufficient to have made any honest man ask
himself some such question as this: &ldquo;After all, is it not quite
possible that those people <i>can</i> run a decent government of their
own? Admiral Dewey says they are superior to the Cubans.&rdquo; But
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb627" href="#pb627" name=
"pb627">627</a>]</span>Mr. McKinley did not pursue this inquiry, as it
was his duty to do. He took the islands because he believed they would
pay, knowing nothing in particular about the Filipinos, except what he
had learned from Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s brief comment, yet hoping in
spite of it that they would turn out sufficiently unfit for
self-government for the event to vindicate the purchase. To demonstrate
that the Filipinos were wholly unfit for the treatment accorded the
Cubans was the only possible justification of the initial departure
from the traditions of the Republic and from the principles which were
its corner-stone. And he made the departure because the business
&ldquo;interests&rdquo; of the country then believed&mdash;erroneously
they all now admit&mdash;that it would pay. He decided to treat eternal
principles as &ldquo;worn-out formul&aelig;.&rdquo; Senator Hoar once
declined an invitation extended by his own city of Worcester, to
deliver a eulogy on Mr. McKinley, because of his Philippine policy.
True, he tempers the asperity of this action thus: &ldquo;It was not
because I was behind any other man in admiration or personal affection
for that lofty and beautiful character. But *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* if a great
Catholic prelate were to die, his eulogy should not be pronounced by a
Protestant.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14198src" href=
"#xd27e14198" name="xd27e14198src">1</a> But all Senator Hoar&rsquo;s
speeches against the McKinley Philippine policy were as emphatic as
Luther&rsquo;s ninety-five theses. He was in possession at the time,
along with the rest of the Senate, of the correspondence with the Paris
Peace Commission made public after the presidential election of
1900.</p>
<p>Ever since Mr. McKinley took the Philippines, it has been the
awkward but inexorable duty of the defenders of that good man&rsquo;s
fame to deprecate Filipino capacity for self-government. President
Taft&rsquo;s chief life-work since this century began has been to take
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb628" href="#pb628" name=
"pb628">628</a>]</span>care of his martyred predecessor&rsquo;s fame,
by proving that Mr. McKinley guessed right in 1898 when he bought the
Philippines and trusted to luck to be able to make out, in spite of
what Admiral Dewey had said, a case sufficiently derogatory to Filipino
intelligence to justify the purchase and subjugation of the islands at
the very time we were freeing Cuba. Obviously, then, the more utterly
unfit for self-government in the present or the near future Mr. Taft
can make the Filipinos out, the nearer he gets to vindicating the
memory of Mr. McKinley, that is, with men of his own, (Mr.
Taft&rsquo;s) high character. He insists on treating as children a
people who got up a well-armed army of thirty-odd thousand men in three
or four months and held at bay, for two years and a half, some 125,000
husky American soldiers, over five times as many as it took to drive
Spain from the Western hemisphere. Physical force is the basis of all
government among men. If President Taft had anything of the soldier
instinct of his immediate predecessor, he would not sniff demagoguery
in the proposition that military efficiency is a better guaranty of
capacity for self-government than all the school-books in the world,
and that proven passionate willingness to die for freedom from alien
domination is the best guaranty conceivable against internecine strife.
It was a tremendous struggle with his own conscience that Mr. McKinley
went through with before he decided to repudiate the principles on
which we took Cuba in order, for a money consideration euphemistically
called &ldquo;trade expansion,&rdquo; to take the Philippines. He had
advices before him at the time making it reasonably certain that this
meant trouble with the Filipinos, i.e., bloodshed in the Philippines,
the extent of which none could foresee, and about which he was of
course apprehensive. In the matter of instructing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb629" href="#pb629" name="pb629">629</a>]</span>our
Paris Peace Commissioners to insist on Spain&rsquo;s ceding us the
Philippines, Mr. McKinley took no moral ground tenable like a rock,
such as truly great men take in great crises of their country&rsquo;s
history. He did not attempt to lead the people. He simply decided that
it would be a <i>popular</i> thing to do to take the islands. Fresh
from a war entered upon to emancipate the Cubans from alien domination,
he took a step which both Admiral Dewey and General Merritt warned him
beforehand would <span class="corr" id="xd27e14212" title=
"Source: probaby">probably</span> mean war&mdash;to subjugate, against
their will, a people superior to the Cubans. And in taking this step,
he took into his confidence, neither the people who paid for the war,
nor the soldiers who fought it. To deny that his motives were
benevolent would be simply stupid. But he followed the mob which
shouted from the rear-end of his observation car and repeated by cable
to the Paris Peace Commission, what the mob yelled. Ever since the
supposed Philippine Klondyke whispered in President McKinley&rsquo;s
ear &ldquo;Eat of the imperial fruits of a colonial policy,&rdquo; the
archives of this government&mdash;the reports of the State, War, and
Navy Departments, and the Congressional Documents&mdash;have reeked
with the inevitable consequences of our fall from our high estate. No
man can serve two masters. Philanthropy for pecuniary profit is a
paradox. Duplicity ever follows deviation from principle. In our
dealings in 1898 with Aguinaldo you find vacillation on the part of
military commanders who personally did not know what fear was, and
embarrassed hypocrisy in dealing with him on the part of men wearing
the shoulder-straps of the American army, athwart the frankness of
whose gaze no such shadow had ever fallen before. You find systematic
concealment of our intentions in dealing with the insurgents, for fear
they would insurge before <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb630" href=
"#pb630" name="pb630">630</a>]</span>the Treaty was signed, and thus
cause such a revulsion of feeling in <i>our</i> country against the
purchase of <i>theirs</i> as to defeat the ratification of the treaty.
After that, you find a systematic minimizing of the opposition to our
rule, reinforced by subtle depreciation of Filipino intelligence, and
backed up by a &ldquo;peace-at-any-price&rdquo; policy, periodically
punctuated by the horrors of war without its dignity. The denial of
Filipino opposition to our rule, which opposition means merely a
natural longing for freedom from alien rule, has gradually been
abandoned. Nobody now clings to that stale fiction. Also, a long course
of chastening, through reconcentration and kindred severities
subsequent to the official announcement of a state of general peace,
has at last gotten the situation as to public order well in hand. The
only question for those who affect that &ldquo;decent respect to the
opinions of mankind&rdquo; which the men of 1776 had in mind is,
&ldquo;Are the Filipinos a people?&rdquo; President Taft was originally
with Senator Hoar on the Philippine question. At least he was an
&ldquo;anti-expansionist.&rdquo; In all the heat of subsequent
controversy he has never made bold to deny the general proposition of
the unalienable right of every people to liberty and the pursuit of
happiness in their own way. His position is that the Filipino people
must be made an exception to the rule because they are not <i>a
people</i>. This is the strongest I can state his proposition for him.
It is very difficult to state even with apparent plausibility, anything
which denies the right of every community of people to immunity from
alien domination. The case must be an extreme one. The issue which the
writer raises with the President&rsquo;s policy is that the Filipinos
<i>are</i> a people.</p>
<p>I know of no graver responsibility that an American statesman can
take upon himself before the bar of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb631" href="#pb631" name="pb631">631</a>]</span>history than to deny
the right of any given people to self-government. Certainly any man who
denies that right at least assumes the burden of proof that they are
unfit to attend to their own affairs. Mr. McKinley assumed it without
pretending to know anything much about the Filipinos, the motive being
that the Islands would be profitable to us. When Mr. Taft went to the
Philippines in 1900, he went, not to investigate the correctness of Mr.
McKinley&rsquo;s assumption, which was implied in the purchase, but to
champion it; not to give advice concerning the righteousness of having
taken over the Philippines, but to bolster up the policy. He assumed
the burden of proof before he knew anything about the facts. The burden
has been on him ever since. Any subordinate who helps him to bear that
burden, finds favor in his eyes. But the burden is greater than he can
bear. The proof fails. The proof shows that the Filipino people ought
to be allowed to pursue happiness in their own way instead of being
made to pursue it in Mr. Taft&rsquo;s way. Once you pretend that our
true object in the Philippines is the &ldquo;pursuit of
happiness&rdquo; for them, The Taft policy is condemned by the facts;
and that is why I am opposed to it. The record shows this. He admits
it. But he insists, with a sigh, that in some other generation they
will be happy. Meantime, we are drifting toward our next war carrying
in tow 8,000,000 of human beings who, if neutralized and let alone
would not be disturbed by our next war, but whose destinies now must be
dependent upon the outcome of such war, however little they may be
concerned in the issues which bring it about.</p>
<p>The shifty opportunism which once actually held out to the Filipinos
the hope of some day becoming a State of the United States of America,
has long since <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb632" href="#pb632" name=
"pb632">632</a>]</span>lapsed into the silence of shame, because no
American ever honestly believed that the American people would ever
countenance any such preposterous proposition. And so a free republic
based on representative government is face to face with the proposition
of having a &ldquo;crown colony&rdquo; on its hands which wishes to be,
and could soon be made fit to be, a free republic also.</p>
<p>If a federal republic cannot live half slave and half free, can it
live with millions of the governed denied a voice in the federal
government confessedly forever? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb633"

railroad connecting Manila Bay with Lingayen Gulf; its further advance
from the northern borders of the plain over the mountains of Central
Luzon; and its march from the central mountains to the northern sea, at
the extreme northern end of the archipelago. We thus saw in detail the
military conquest and occupation of that part of Luzon lying north of
the Pasig River. Before leaving that part of the subject, the way the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb634" href="#pb634" name=
"pb634">634</a>]</span>provinces thus occupied were grouped into
military districts was indicated. Following the lines of the military
occupation, it was shown that Northern Luzon was naturally and
conveniently susceptible of division into four groups of provinces,
which groups might ultimately be evolved into self-governing
commonwealths&mdash;States of a Philippine Federal Union, as
follows:</p>

<p>It will be remembered that after our narrative had followed the
occupation of Northern Luzon by the American forces to practical
completion, we turned to that part of Luzon lying south of Manila, and
followed the military occupation as it was gradually extended from the
Pasig River to the extreme point of Southern Luzon. Before closing the
review of that military panorama, suggestions were made for an ultimate
grouping of the provinces of Southern Luzon into two governmental units
intended to be ultimately evolved into states. Those suggestions
contemplated grouping the provinces of the lake region bordering on the
Laguna de Bay and the adjacent provinces, into a territory designated
for convenience as Cavite.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14335src" href=
"#xd27e14335" name="xd27e14335src">5</a> This territory was to include
all of Southern Luzon except the hemp peninsula, which lies to the
south of the Lake <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb635" href="#pb635"
name="pb635">635</a>]</span>country. It was also suggested in the same
connection that the three provinces of the hemp peninsula might form a
convenient ultimate State of Camarines. In other words, two states can
be made out of Southern Luzon as follows:</p>

<p>To recapitulate: All of Luzon except Manila and the vicinity can at
once be divided into the six groups of provinces above
mentioned&mdash;&ldquo;territories,&rdquo; having what we are
accustomed in the United States to call a &ldquo;territorial form of
government,&rdquo; and intended to be made states later. Luzon is about
the size of Cuba (a little over 40,000 sq. miles), is twice as thickly
populated (nearly 4,000,000 to Cuba&rsquo;s 2,000,000), and is not
cursed with a negro question, as Cuba is.</p>
<p>The above totals, be it remembered, are only round numbers, but they
get us &ldquo;out of the woods&rdquo; so to speak, and away from a lot
of unpronounceable names. They show you how to handle Luzon as if it
were about the size of Ohio&mdash;which it is. And, as has already been
made clear in the earlier part of this volume, Luzon
&ldquo;<i>is</i>&rdquo; the Philippines, in a very suggestive sense of
the phrase, since it contains half the land area of the archipelago
(outside of the Mohammedan island of Mindanao), and half the total
population of the whole archipelago, besides being eight or ten times
as large as any other island of the group except Mindanao; and it also
contains the city which is the capital and chief port of the
archipelago, and has been the seat of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb636" href="#pb636" name="pb636">636</a>]</span>government for over
three hundred years&mdash;Manila. And Manila is eight or ten times as
large as any other town in the archipelago.</p>
<p>After the occupation of Luzon, General Otis&rsquo;s extension of our
occupation to the Visayan islands was reviewed, and in that connection
it was pointed out that each of the six largest of those islands to
wit, Panay, Negros, Cebu, Leyte, Samar, Bohol, might be ultimately
evolved into six states.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14390src" href=
"#xd27e14390" name="xd27e14390src">6</a></p>
<p>The smaller islands lying between Luzon and Mindanao could easily be
disposed of governmentally by being attached to the jurisdiction of one
of the said six islands.</p>
<p>There is to-day no reason why a dozen Americans could not be at once
appointed governors of the twelve prospective autonomous commonwealths
above indicated, just as the President of the United States has in the
past appointed governors for New Mexico, Arizona, and other territories
of the United States which have subsequently been admitted to the
Union. If the Congress of the United States should promise the
Filipinos independence, to be granted as soon as American authority in
the Islands should so recommend, the dozen territorial governments
intended to be evolved into states of an ultimate federal union could
soon be whipped into shape where they could take care of themselves to
the extent that our state governments to-day take care of themselves.
American representatives of American authority in the Islands, sent out
to work out such a programme, might be instructed to watch these twelve
territorial governments, granting to each the right to elect a governor
in lieu of the appointed governor as soon as in their judgment a given
territory was worthy of it. I have no doubt <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb637" href="#pb637" name="pb637">637</a>]</span>that
such recommendations would follow successively as to all of said
prospective states inside of four or five years. Whether this plan is
wise or not, it certainly is not, as far as I am concerned, &ldquo;half
baked.&rdquo; Some five years ago, in the <i>North American
Review</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14407src" href="#xd27e14407"
name="xd27e14407src">7</a> I suggested that Luzon could be so organized
within less than ten years by American territorial governors selected
for the work, naming the Honorable George Curry of New Mexico, formerly
Governor of the territory of New Mexico, and now a member of Congress
therefrom, as an ideal man to organize one such territory. It is true
that there are not eleven other men as well qualified for the work as
Governor Curry. In fact he is probably better qualified for the work
than any man living. The language used as to Governor Curry in the
<i>North American Review</i> article referred to was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">If the inhabitants of these regions were told by a man
whom they liked and would believe, as they would Curry, that they were
to have autonomous governments like one of the Western Territories of
the United States, at the very earliest possible moment, and urged to
get ready for it, they could and would, under his guidance. We would
get a co-operation from those people we do not now get and never will
get, so long as we keep them in uncertainty as to what we are going to
do with them. If next year we should formally disclaim intention to
retain the islands permanently, and set to work to create autonomous
Territories destined ultimately to be States of a Federated Philippine
Republic, whenever fit, we would soon see the way out of this tangle,
and behold the beginning of the end of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever the twelve territorial governments should be gotten into
smooth working order under elected <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb638"
href="#pb638" name="pb638">638</a>]</span>native governors, the
Philippine archipelago would then be <i>nearly</i> ready for
independence, so far as its internal affairs are concerned. The danger
of their being annexed on the first pretext by some one of the great
land-grabbing powers should be met by our guaranteeing them their
independence, as we do Cuba, until they could be protected by
neutralization treaties, such as protect Belgium and Switzerland
to-day, as explained in the chapter which follows this. Powers not
specifically granted to the several states-in-embryo should of course,
until the final grant of independence, be reserved to the central
government at Manila. Manila and Rizal province would be available at
almost any time as a thirteenth state. So that when the twelve states
above suggested had shown themselves capable of local self-government,
Manila and Rizal province might be added to make the final one of
thirteen original states of a Philippine Republic.</p>
<p>Any American who has seen a Filipino <i>pueblo</i> transformed, as
if by magic, from listless apathy to a state of buzzing and busy
enthusiasm suggestive of a bee-hive, by preparations for some church
<i>fiesta</i>, or for the coming of some dignitary from Manila, has
seen something analogous to what would happen if the Filipino body
politic should suddenly be electrified by a promise of independence
under some such programme as the above. A generous rivalry would at
once ensue all over the archipelago in each of the twelve prospective
states. Each would seek to be the first to be recommended by American
authority as ready for statehood. I do not believe the annals of
national experience contain any analogy where every member of a given
community has rallied to a common cause more completely than the whole
Filipino people would rally to such a prospective programme of
independence. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb639" href="#pb639"
name="pb639">639</a>]</span>unanimity would be as absolute as the kind
we saw among the American people at the outbreak of the Spanish War,
when Congress one fine morning placed fifty millions of dollars at the
disposal of President McKinley by a unanimous vote.</p>
<p>I especially invite attention to the fact that the above programme
throws away nothing that has been done by us in the Islands in the last
twelve years in the way of organization. It simply takes it and builds
upon it. Congress should not attempt to work out the details from this
end of the line. We should send men out there from here to work them
out, with local co-operation from the leading Filipinos. Men animated
by the idea of working out a programme under which <i>the living</i>
may hope to see the independence of their country, should be sent out
to take the place of the men now there who are irrevocably committed to
the programme of indefinite retention with undeclared intention, which
holds out no hope to the living. It is not wise to arrange the details
of the programme by act of Congress without a year or two of study of
the situation by such men <i>on the ground</i>. An act of Congress
which goes into details before getting the recommendations of such men
will inevitably set up a lot of straw men easy for the other side to
knock down. All you need is a program, sanctioned by Congress,
containing a promise of independence, and men sent out to the islands
to work out the program. They would report back from time to time, and
the Congress by whose authority they went out would have no hesitation
in being guided by their recommendations. If unpatriotic greed for
office among the Filipinos, or other opposition animated by evil
motives, should block the game, your Americans so sent out would have
to recommend the calling of a halt. This ever-present shadow in the
background <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb640" href="#pb640" name=
"pb640">640</a>]</span>would in turn throw the shadow of ostracism over
all demagogues.</p>
<p>Meantime the Filipinos should be given a Senate, or upper house, in
which, the thirteen prospective &ldquo;states&rdquo; should be
represented by two men, the bill therefor to be framed out there, and
sent back here to Congress for approval. This would give them under the
plan here suggested, as soon as the Americans sent out should so
recommend, a Senate of twenty-six members. At present, if the native
Assembly, or lower house, does not pass the annual appropriations
necessary to run the government, the appropriation act of the preceding
year again becomes law. At present, the upper house is the Philippine
Commission. By withholding its consent, it can prevent any legislation
whatsoever. So, at present, the Assembly is little more than a debating
society. All questions as to appropriations, veto of legislation, and
other details, in the event the Filipinos are given a Senate also,
should be left to be fixed in the bill recommended by the men sent out
to work out the program of promise.</p>
<p>On March 20, 1912, Honorable W. A. Jones, the distinguished veteran
Congressman from Virginia, who is Chairman of the Committee on Insular
Affairs, introduced in the House of Representatives a bill entitled
&ldquo;A bill to establish a qualified independence for the
Philippines, and to fix the date when such qualified independence shall
become absolute and complete.&rdquo; The greater part of what precedes
this paragraph of this chapter was written prior to March 20, 1912. Mr.
Jones&rsquo;s bill works out the details of the independence problem in
a manner somewhat different from the plan I suggest, but that does not
make me any the less heartily in favor of the principle which his bill
embodies. The supreme virtue of the Jones <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb641" href="#pb641" name="pb641">641</a>]</span>bill is that it
promises Independence at a fixed date, July 4, 1921. It ends the cruel
uncertainty, so unjust to both the Filipinos and to the Americans in
the Philippines, that is contained in the present program of indefinite
retention with undeclared intention. Five years ago, in the <i>North
American Review</i> for January 18, and June 21, 1907, the writer
hereof expressed the belief that an earlier date was feasible,
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">If three strong and able men, familiar with insular
conditions, and still young enough to undertake the task<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e14457src" href="#xd27e14457" name=
"xd27e14457src">8</a> were told by a President of the United States, by
authority of the Congress, &ldquo;Go out there and set up a respectable
native government in ten years, and then come away,&rdquo; they could
and would do it, and that government would be a success; and one of the
greatest moral victories in the annals of free government would have
been written by the gentlemen concerned upon the pages of their
country&rsquo;s history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Mr. Jones&rsquo;s bill allows four years more of time, I believe
it to be absolutely safe.</p>
<p>Governor Curry, the Congressman from New Mexico hereinabove
mentioned, who spent eight years in the Philippines, agrees with the
fundamental principle of the Jones bill, that as to making a definite
promise <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb642" href="#pb642" name=
"pb642">642</a>]</span>of Independence within a few years, and does not
consider 1921 too early.</p>
<p>Under the present law, the Philippine Assembly has some eighty
members, each supposed to represent 90,000 people, more or less. This
tallies, roughly, with the census total of population, which is
7,600,000.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14469src" href="#xd27e14469"
name="xd27e14469src">9</a> Under the existing law in the Philippines,
the qualifications for voting are really of two kinds, though nominally
of three kinds. There is a property qualification, and there is an
educational qualification. In any case, in order to vote, the
individual must be twenty-one years old, and must have lived for six
months in the place where he offers to vote. The property qualification
requires that the would-be voter own at least $250 worth of property,
or pay a tax to the amount of $15. The explanation of how a man may not
own $250 worth of property and yet pay $15 taxes is that under the old
Spanish system, which we partially adopted, a man might pay such
<i>cedula</i> or poll-tax as he preferred, according to a graduated
scale, certain civic rights being accorded to those voluntarily paying
the higher poll-tax which were denied to those paying less. The
educational qualification requires the would-be voter to speak, read,
and write either English or Spanish, or else to have held certain
enumerated small municipal offices under the Spaniards&mdash;before the
American occupation. Mr. Jones&rsquo;s bill proposes to add the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb643" href="#pb643" name=
"pb643">643</a>]</span>speaking, reading, and writing of the native
dialect of a given locality<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14477src" href=
"#xd27e14477" name="xd27e14477src">10</a> to the educational
qualification. This would double, or perhaps triple, the electorate,
and would, in my judgment, be wise. Thousands upon thousands of natives
who only <i>speak</i> a little Spanish can both <i>speak, read, and
write</i> their native Tagalo, Ilocano, or Visayan, as the case may be.
The total of those qualified to vote for members of the Assembly in
1907 was only about 100,000. At a later election, that number was
doubled. If there are 7,500,000 people in the archipelago, one fifth of
these should represent the adult male population, say 1,500,000. Under
Mr. Jones&rsquo;s bill, the electorate would probably increase to half
a million long before the date he proposes for independence, July 4,
1921. But all such details as qualification for voting might, it seems
to me, be left to people on the ground, their recommendations
controlling. Under a promise of independence by 1921, a very fair
electorate of at least one third, possibly one half, of the adult male
population, could be built up. As the majority report on the Jones
Bill, dated April 26, 1912, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">For nearly ten years the average public-school
enrolment has not been less than 500,000.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e14490src" href="#xd27e14490" name="xd27e14490src">11</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb644" href="#pb644" name=
"pb644">644</a>]</span></p>
<p>I believe that the Moros should be left as they are for the present.
The time for solving that problem has not yet been reached. Mr. Jones
himself evidently bases his idea of allowing the Moro country
representation in the Philippine Congress, or legislature provided by
his bill, on the probability that enough Christian people will vote,
down there, to make up an electorate that would not be
&ldquo;impossible,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, absurd. For instance, he tells
me that a great many people have moved into Mindanao from the northern
islands for commercial reasons, and, if I recollect correctly, that
Zamboanga, the most beautiful little port in Mindanao, which hardly had
10,000 people when I was there, now has possibly 50,000. But the Moro
question need not stand in the way of setting up an independent
government in the Philippines in 1921, as proposed by his bill. You
have material for thirteen original states, representing a population
of nearly seven million Christian people, in Luzon and the six main
Visayan Islands. Why delay the creation of this republic on account of
250,000 semi-civilized, crudely Mohammedan Moros in Mindanao&mdash;a
separate island lying off to the south of the proposed
republic?<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14499src" href="#xd27e14499" name=
"xd27e14499src">12</a> A happy solution of the matter would be to send
Mr. Jones out there as Governor-General and let him work out the
problem on the ground. He has had a long and distinguished career in
the public service, twenty-two years in Congress. His public record and
speeches on the Philippine question from the beginning would make him
to the Filipinos the very incarnation of a <i>bona fide</i> intention
on our part to give them their independence <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb645" href="#pb645" name="pb645">645</a>]</span>at
the earliest practical moment, that is, at some time which <i>the
living</i> might hope to see. When Governor Taft and Mr. Root drew the
Philippine Government Act of 1902, the former had already been
president of the Philippine Commission for two years, had been all over
the archipelago, and knew it well. Suppose the Taft policy should be
substituted by the more progressive Jones policy. Mr. Jones, or whoever
is to change the policy, ought to have as much acquaintance with the
subject, acquired on the ground, as Mr. Taft had when he formulated his
policy of indefinite retention with undeclared intention. The nucleus
of the Taft policy was stated by Governor Taft to the Senate Committee
in 1902, as follows<a class="noteref" id="xd27e14514src" href=
"#xd27e14514" name="xd27e14514src">13</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">My own judgment is that the best policy, if a policy
is to be declared at all, is to declare the intention of the United
States to hold the islands indefinitely, until the people shall show
themselves fit for self-government, under a gradually increasing
popular government, when their relation to the United States, either of
statehood, or of quasi-independence, like the colony of Australia or
Canada, can be declared after mutual conference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The policy which Mr. Jones has favored for the last twelve years is
almost as well known to the Filipinos as are the views of Mr. Taft
himself.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the writer desires to say, with especial emphasis,
that the suggestions outlining the plan which forms the bulk of this
chapter are presented in a spirit of entire deference to the views of
any one else who may have considered this great subject carefully,
especially to the views of Mr. Jones, whose bill is so entirely right
in principle. The one supreme need of the situation is a definite
legislative declaration which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb646"
href="#pb646" name="pb646">646</a>]</span>shall make clear to all
concerned&mdash;to the Filipino demagogue and the American grafter, as
well as to the great body of the good people of both races out
there&mdash;that the governing of a remote and alien people is to have
no permanent place in the purposes of our national life; and that we do
<i>bona fide</i> intend to give the Filipinos their independence at a
date in the future which will interest <i>the living</i>, by extending
to <i>the living</i> the hope to see the independence of their country.
And the Jones Bill does that. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb647"

any reader who is or may hereafter be clothed with authority, I desire
to say here, on the very highest public grounds, that, in my judgment,
Judge Carson is the most considerable man we have out there now
(1912)&mdash;a good man to have in an emergency. Though not as learned
in the law as his colleague, Justice Johnson&mdash;who is quite the
equal, as a jurist, of most of the Federal judges I know in the United

the census of the Philippines of 1903, vol. ii., p. 15: &ldquo;The
total population of the Philippine Archipelago on March 2, 1903, was
7,635,426. Of this number, 6,987,686 enjoyed a considerable degree of
civilization, while the remainder, 647,740, consisted of wild
people.&rdquo; By this same Census, the Moros are classified as
uncivilized, and the population of the island on which they live,
Mindanao, is given at about 500,000 (499,634, vol. ii., p. 126), of
which about half only (252,940) are Moros, the rest being civilized.
The total of the uncivilized people of the archipelago, according to
the Census, is 647,740 (vol. ii., p. 123), less than 400,000, leaving
out the Moros.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Tagalo, Ilocano, and Visayan are the three main dialects that have been
evolved into written language by the patience of the Spanish priests in
the last couple of hundred years or so. Probably five sixths of the
people of the archipelago speak some one of these three dialects. In
fact they can hardly be called &ldquo;dialects,&rdquo; for there are
plenty of books&mdash;novels, plays, grammars, histories, dictionaries,
etc.&mdash;written in Tagalo, Ilocano, or Visayan. Every educated
Filipino of the well-to-do classes grows up speaking Spanish and the
dialect of his native province, while the latter is the only language
spoken by the less fortunate people of his neighborhood, the poorer
classes.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd27e14477src">&uarr;</a></p>

<p class="xd27e244"><span class="sc">M. de Martens</span> in the
<i lang="fr">Revue des Deux Mondes</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On March 25, 1912, Honorable W. A. Jones, of Virginia,
Chairman of the House Committee on Insular Affairs, introduced a
resolution (<i>H. J. 278</i>) proposing the neutralization of the
Philippines, to accompany his Philippine Independence Bill discussed in
the preceding chapter. Such a resolution, accompanying such a bill,
both introduced by one of the majority leaders in the House of
Representatives, lifts the question of Philippine neutralization out of
the region of the &ldquo;academic,&rdquo; and brings it forward as a
thing which must, sooner or later, command the serious consideration
both of Congress and the country. There have been many such resolutions
before that of Mr. Jones. But they are all the same in principle. All
contemplate our guaranteeing the Filipinos their independence until the
treaties they propose shall be consummated. In 1911, there were at
least nine such resolutions proposing neutralization of the
Philippines, introduced by the following named gentlemen, the first a
Republican, the rest Democrats:</p>
<p>Mr. McCall, of Massachusetts; Mr. Cline, of Indiana; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb648" href="#pb648" name="pb648">648</a>]</span>Mr.
Sabath, of Illinois; Mr. Garner, of Texas; Mr. Peters, of
Massachusetts; Mr. Martin, of Colorado; Mr. Burgess, of Texas; Mr.
Oldfield, of Arkansas; and Mr. Ferris, of Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Because the neutralization plan to provide against the Philippines
being annexed by some other Power in case we ever give them their
independence would, if successfully worked out, reduce by that much the
possible area of war, and be a distinct step in the direction of
universal peace, it is certainly worthy of careful consideration by the
enlightened judgment of the Congress and the world.</p>
<p>Mr. McCall is the father of the neutralization idea, so far as the
House of Representatives is concerned, application of it to the
Philippines having been first suggested at the Universal Peace
Conference of 1904, by Mr. Erving Winslow, of Boston. Mr. McCall has
been introducing his neutralization resolution at every Congress for a
number of Congresses past.</p>
<p>The McCall Resolution (<i>H. J. Res. 107</i>) is the oldest, and
perhaps the simplest, of the various pending resolutions for the
neutralization of the Philippines, and is typical of all. It reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">JOINT RESOLUTION</p>
<p>Declaring the purpose of the United States to recognize the
independence of the Filipino people as soon as a stable government can
be established, and requesting the President to open negotiations for
the neutralization of the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p><i>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled</i>:</p>
<p>That in accordance with the principles upon which its government is
founded and which were again asserted by it at the outbreak of the war
with Spain, the United States <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb649"
href="#pb649" name="pb649">649</a>]</span>declares that the Filipino
people of right ought to be free and independent, and announces its
purpose to recognize their independence as soon as a stable government,
republican in form, can be established by them, and thereupon to
transfer to such government all its rights in the Philippine Islands
upon terms which shall be reasonable and just, and to leave the
sovereignty and control of their country to the Filipino people.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the President of the United States be, and he
hereby is, requested to open negotiations with such foreign Powers as
in his opinion should be parties to the compact for the neutralization
of the Philippine Islands by international agreement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the McCall Resolution, or any one of the kindred resolutions,
were passed, and complied with by the President of the United States,
and accepted by the other Powers, and the Filipinos were helped to
organize territorial governments such as Arizona and New Mexico were
before they became States, several such territories could form the
nucleus about which to begin to build at once, as indicated in the
chapter on &ldquo;The Road to Autonomy.&rdquo; A number of such
territories could be made at once as completely autonomous as the
governments of the territories of Arizona and New Mexico were before
their admission to our Union. With those examples to emulate, together
with the tingling of the general blood that would follow a promise of
independence and a national life of their own, similar territorial
governments could be successively organized, as indicated in the
preceding chapter, throughout the archipelago. These could, in less
than ten years, be fitted for admission to a federal union of
autonomous territories, with the string of our sovereignty still tied
to it, and an American Governor-General still over the whole, as now.
And when the last island knocked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb650"
href="#pb650" name="pb650">650</a>]</span>for admission and was
admitted, the string could be cut, and the Federal Union of Territories
admitted, through our good offices, to the sisterhood of nations, as an
independent Philippine republic. They would not bother the rest of the
world any more than Belgium and Switzerland do, which are likewise
protected by neutralization.</p>
<p>The idea of international neutralization is not without pride of
ancestry or hope of posterity. It was born out of the downfall of
Napoleon I. The Treaty of Paris of 1815 declared that</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">the neutrality and inviolability of Switzerland, as
well as its independence of outside influences, are in conformity with
the true interests of European politics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Congress of Vienna, held afterwards in the same year, at which
there were present, besides the various monarchs, such men as
Wellington, Talleyrand, and Metternich, solemnly and finally reiterated
that declaration. Would not &ldquo;the neutrality and
inviolability&rdquo; of the Philippines be gladly acceded to by the
great Powers as being &ldquo;in conformity with the true interests of
European politics,&rdquo; and Asiatic politics as well?</p>
<p>Says M. De Martens, in an article in the <i lang="fr">Revue des Deux
Mondes</i> for November 15, 1903:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Respect for the perpetual neutrality of Switzerland
has now taken such lodgment in the conscience of the civilized nations
of Europe that its violation would inevitably provoke a storm of
indignation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At present, the Philippines are a potential apple of discord thrown
into the Balance of Power in the Pacific. The present policy of
indefinite retention by us, with undeclared intention, leaves everybody
guessing, including <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb651" href="#pb651"
name="pb651">651</a>]</span>ourselves. Now is the accepted time, while
the horizon of the future is absolutely cloudless, to ask Japan to sign
a treaty agreeing not to annex the Philippine Islands after we give
them their independence. By her answer she will show her hand. The
overcrowded monarchies do not pretend any special scruples about
annexing anything annexable. Germany very frankly insists that she
became a great Power too late to get her rightful share of the
earth&rsquo;s surface, and that she <i>must</i> expand somewhither. And
only the virile menace of the Monroe Doctrine has so far stayed her
heavy hand from seizing some portion of South America. But probably
none of the Powers would object to converting the Philippines into
permanently neutral territory, by the same kind of an agreement that
protects Switzerland.</p>
<p>The Treaty of London of 1831, relative to Belgium and Holland,
declares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Within the limits indicated, Belgium shall form an
independent and perpetually neutral state. She shall be required to
observe this same neutrality toward all the other states.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The signatories to this treaty were Great Britain, France, Austria,
Prussia, and Russia. Forty years after it was made, during the
Franco-Prussian war, when Belgium&rsquo;s neutrality was threatened by
manifestations of intention on the part both of France and of Prussia
to occupy some of her territory, England served notice on both parties
to the conflict that if either violated the territorial integrity of
Belgium, she, England, would join forces with the other. And the treaty
was observed. The specific way in which observance of it was compassed
was this: Great Britain made representations to both France and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb652" href="#pb652" name=
"pb652">652</a>]</span>Germany which resulted in two identical
conventions, signed in August, 1870, at Paris and Berlin, whereby any
act of aggression by either against Belgium was to be followed by
England&rsquo;s joining forces with the other against the aggressor. So
long as human nature does not change very materially, &ldquo;the
green-eyed monster&rdquo; will remain a powerful factor in human
affairs. The mutual jealousy of the Powers will always be the saving
grace, in troubled times, of neutralization treaties signed in time of
profound peace. If &ldquo;Balance of Power&rdquo; considerations in
Europe have protected the Turkish Empire from annexation or
dismemberment all these years, without a neutralization treaty, why
will not the mutual jealousy of the Powers insure the signing and
faithful observance of a treaty tending to preserve the Balance of
Power in the Pacific? Who would object?</p>
<p>The Panama Canal is to be opened in 1913. We want South America to
be a real friend to the Monroe Doctrine, which she certainly is not
enthusiastic about now, and will never be while we remain wedded to the
McKinley Doctrine of Benevolent Assimilation of unconsenting
people&mdash;people anxious to develop, under God, along their own
lines. In 1906, while Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Root
made a tour of South America. He told those people down there, at Rio
Janeiro, by way of quieting their fears lest we may some day be moved
to &ldquo;improve&rdquo; <i>their</i> condition also, through
benevolent assimilation and vigorous application of the
&ldquo;uplift&rdquo; treatment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We wish for *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* no territory except our
own. We deem the independence and equal rights of the smallest and
weakest member of the family of nations entitled to as much respect as
those of the greatest empire, and we deem <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb653" href="#pb653" name="pb653">653</a>]</span>the observance of
that respect the chief guaranty of the weak against the oppression of
the strong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That Rio Janeiro speech of Mr. Root&rsquo;s is as noble a
masterpiece of real eloquence, its setting and all considered, as any
utterance of any statesman of modern times. Among other things, he
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">No student of our times can fail to see that not
America alone but the whole civilized world is swinging away from its
old governmental moorings and intrusting the fate of its civilization
to the capacity of the popular mass to govern. By this pathway mankind
is to travel, whithersoever it leads. <i>Upon the success of this, our
great undertaking, the hope of humanity depends.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Secretary of War, &ldquo;civilizing with a Krag,&rdquo; Mr. Root
reminds one of Cortez and Pizarro. As Secretary of State, he permits us
to believe that all the great men are not dead yet.</p>
<p>If, in making that Rio Janeiro speech, Mr. Root laid to his soul the
flattering unction that the minds of his hearers did not revert
dubiously to his previous grim missionary work in the Philippines,
where the percentage of literacy is superior to that of more than one
Latin-American republic, he is very much mistaken. If he is laboring
under any such delusion, let him read a book written since then by a
distinguished South American publicist, called <i>El Porvenir de La
Americana Latina</i> (&ldquo;The Future of Latin America&rdquo;). If he
does not read Spanish, he can divine the contents of the book from the
cartoon which adorns the title-page. The cartoon represents the
American eagle, flag in claw, standing on the map of North America,
looking toward South America as if ready for flight, its beak bent over
Panama, the shadow of its wings already darkening <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb654" href="#pb654" name="pb654">654</a>]</span>the
northern portions of the sister continent to the south of us. To get
the trade of South America, in the mighty struggle for commercial
supremacy which is to follow the opening of the Panama Canal, we must
win the confidence of South America. We will never do it until we do
the right thing by the Filipinos. Concerning the Philippines, South
America reflects that we annexed the first supposedly rich
non-contiguous Spanish country we ever had a chance to annex that we
had not previously solemnly vowed we would not annex. We must choose
between the Monroe Doctrine of mutually respectful Fraternal Relation,
which contemplates some twenty-one mutually trustful republics in the
Western Hemisphere, all a unit against alien colonization here, and the
McKinley Doctrine of grossly patronizing Benevolent Assimilation, which
contemplates some 8,000,000 of people in the Eastern Hemisphere, all a
unit against alien colonization there&mdash;a people, moreover, whose
friendship we have cultivated with the Gatling gun and the gallows, and
watered with tariff and other legislation enacted without knowledge and
used without shame.</p>
<p>We should stop running a kindergarten for adults in Asia, and get
back to the Monroe Doctrine. There are only two hemispheres to a
sphere, and our manifest destiny lies in the Western one. We do not
want the earth. Our mission as a nation is to conserve the republican
form of government, and the consent-of-the-governed principle, and to
promote the general peace of mankind by insuring it in our half of the
earth. The first thing to do to set this country right again is to get
rid of the Philippines, and give them a square deal, pursuant to the
spirit of the neutralization resolutions now pending before Congress.
All these resolutions contain the one supreme need of the hour,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb655" href="#pb655" name=
"pb655">655</a>]</span>an honest declaration of intention. The longer
we fight shy of that, the less likely we are ever to give the Filipinos
their independence, and the deeper we get into the mire of mistaken
philanthropy and covert exploitation.</p>
<p>We should resume our original programme of blazing out the path and
making clear the way up which any nation of the earth may follow when
it will. That path lies along the line of actually attempting as a
nation a practical demonstration of the Power of Righteousness, or, in
other words, the existence of an Omnipotent Omniscient Benevolent Good
(whether you spell it with one <i>o</i> or with two is not important)
shaping, guiding, and directing human affairs, such demonstration to be
made through the concerted action of a self-governing people under a
written Constitution based on equality of opportunity and the Golden
Rule.</p>
<p>As a people we are very young yet. It is not yet written in the Book
of Time how long this nation will survive. So far, our government is
only an experiment. But, as John Quincy Adams once said, it and its
Constitution are &ldquo;an experiment upon the human heart,&rdquo; to
see whether or not the Golden Rule will work in government among men.

<p><b>James Henderson Blount</b> (1869&ndash;1918) was a US judge who
went in to the Philippines as a volunteer shortly after the US took
over this colony from Spain. After his experiences, he became critical
of the US policy in the Philippines, and urged for an early
independence of the country.</p>
<p><i>The American Occupation of the Philippines, 1898&ndash;1912</i>
(first published in 1912) is a critical work on the American rule in
the Philippines. This work is much criticized by Dean Worchester in his
book, <i><a class="pglink xd27e34" title=
"Link to Project Gutenberg ebook" href=
"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12077">The Philippines, Past and
Present</a></i> (1914), also present in Project Gutenberg. The latter
was only returning the favor, as Dean Worcester receives in this work a
full chapter of harsh criticism.</p>
<p>This book is prepared from scans of the first edition, available at
the Internet Archive: <a class="seclink xd27e34" title="External link"

have been taken from scans of the second edition from 1913: <a class=
